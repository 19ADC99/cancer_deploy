<ul>
<li>Here we investigate the transcriptomics data across the three Kidney Cancers.</li>
<li>First we filter lowly expressed genes and we do some exploratory analyses on samples, gene expression and clinical covariates.</li>
<li>We then run a formal Differential Gene Expression analysis to identify genes that have different expression levels across the three Kidney cancer types.</li>
<li>We perform Gene Set Enrichment Analyses on the differentially expressed genes to investigate biological and molecular themes that discriminates between the three Kidney cancer types.</li>
<li>Finally, we characterize the tumour micro-environments of the three Kidney cancer types by quantifying the tumour-infiltrating immune cells.</li>
</ul>
<p>For TCGA Kidney cancer micro RNAs data, we will perform analyses similar to the ones performed for the transcriptomics one (see <a href="transcriptomics-analysis.html" class="quarto-xref"><span>Chapter 2</span></a>) and proteomics (see <a href="transcriptomics-analysis.html" class="quarto-xref"><span>Chapter 2</span></a>).

<p>The first 21 Principal Components capture more than 80% of the variance in the Kidney cancers transcriptomics dataset, with the first two components (PC1 and PC2) capturing a bit more than 40% of the variance.</p>
<p>When we project the samples in the PC1 and PC2, we can see that the PC1 separates KIRC from KICH and KIRP, which instead cluster together. The second component PC2, instead, seems to separate KICH and KIRP samples. The separation between KICH and KIRP samples along component PC2 is clearer in the proteomics data than in the transcriptomics data.</p>

<p>Let’s check the loadings (i.e.: 21 Principal Components capture more than 80% of the variance in the) for the top 4 Principal Components. These indicate which genes are the more responsible to explain the position of the samples along the components, and the direction of this separation.</p>
<p>[[[[ADAPT TO PROTEOMICS RESULTS]]]]</p>
<p>Looking at the top 1% most variable genes (~ 140 genes), the following 5 genes are the top loadings for the first 4 Principal Components:</p>

<p>The miR-200 family as prognostic markers in clear cell renal cell carcinoma</p>
<p>mir-200c</p>
<p>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31635993/</p>
<p>Let’s check the Pearson correlation with other clinical covariates.</p>
<p>[[[[ADAPT TO PROTEOMICS RESULTS]]]]</p>
<p>Certain histological and molecular subtyping correlates perfectly with PC1 and PC2 (which discriminates KICH) immune infiltrating cells also correlates with PC1 and PC2, and may help to further characterize the subtypes and stratify patients</p>
<p>As we have learnt before (<a href="dataset-exploration.html#sec-dataset-exploration" class="quarto-xref"><span>Section 1.3.7</span></a>), KIRC patients seems to had a worse outcome than KIRP and to have tumors in more advanced stages. PC1 (computed from transcriptomics data) clearly separates KIRC and KIRP samples, and it correlates with tumor histological grade and stage, as well as clinical outcome. This show that we have good correlation between clinical observations and gene espression in Kidney cancers.</p>
<p>sadly, no correlation between the top 5 components and the outcome of therapeutic care.</p>
