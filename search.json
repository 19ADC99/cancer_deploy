    "text": "Abstract\n[[rewrite]]\nThe complex and heterogeneous nature of cancer necessitates innovative approaches for effective target discovery and therapeutic development. Multiomics integration—combining genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolomic, and epigenomic data—has emerged as a transformative strategy in cancer research, significantly accelerating the identification of novel therapeutic targets. By leveraging the wealth of biological information from multiple layers of molecular data, researchers can gain comprehensive insights into tumor biology, elucidate underlying mechanisms of disease progression, and uncover potential vulnerabilities in cancer cells.\nRecent advancements in computational tools and methodologies have enabled the seamless integration of multiomics data. Techniques such as network analysis, machine learning, and pathway enrichment analysis facilitate the identification of key molecular interactions and regulatory networks that drive tumorigenesis (Duan et al., 2021; DOI: 10.1016/j.cell.2021.03.005). Furthermore, integrative approaches can reveal context-specific biomarkers and therapeutic targets that may be overlooked when examining individual omics datasets in isolation (Huang et al., 2020; DOI: 10.1038/s41598-020-64873-7).\nThe availability of public databases, such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Genomic Data Commons (GDC), and the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE), plays a crucial role in facilitating multiomics integration. These resources provide a rich repository of high-quality data, allowing researchers to validate findings across diverse cancer types and patient populations. The utilization of such publicly available data enhances the reproducibility and robustness of target discovery efforts while promoting collaborative research (Ghandi et al., 2019; DOI: 10.1038/s41586-019-0361-1).\nMoreover, multiomics integration enhances the identification of patient-specific therapeutic targets, paving the way for personalized medicine. By integrating patient-derived multiomics data, researchers can uncover unique tumor profiles that inform targeted treatment strategies, improving clinical outcomes (Berglund et al., 2020; DOI: 10.1016/j.cell.2020.09.034). The dynamic interplay between genetic alterations and their downstream effects on cellular pathways underscores the need for comprehensive multiomics analyses in cancer research.\nIn conclusion, the integration of multiomics data is revolutionizing cancer target discovery by providing a holistic view of tumor biology, enhancing our understanding of complex molecular interactions, and facilitating the identification of novel therapeutic strategies. The continued collaboration between public databases and cutting-edge analytical techniques will be pivotal in translating these discoveries into clinical applications, ultimately improving patient outcomes in cancer treatment.",

From the Xena platform, we can find the data from Pan-Cancer Atlas consortium, which provides textbook high quality datasets that can be explored for target discovery in cancer.\nTCGA PanCan collects 12,839 samples from 28 organs, 69 primary sites spanning 32 different cancer types.\nThe metadata available for the samples and the subjects include:\nFor these samples, there are available rich clinical metadata and matched multiomics datasets.\nWe can retrieved the following multiomics readouts:\nAll the multiomics readouts are at the gene level, except for the DNA methylation data, that will have to be mapped and normalized at the gene level. Luckily, a mapping file is available as well.\nXena provides as well already precomputed enrichments and cell types deconvolutions:\nI assure you that integrating all these data will be fun, and it will provide deep insights on each cancer we decided to analyse.",

    "text": "Samples Overview\nNext step is to integrate together all the available sample and subjects metadata. This allows to break down the samples by cancer type and demographic distributions. While Xena provides some information, it lacks a cleaned table containing all the demographic information of the subjects. Conveniently, GitHub user ipezoa already retrieved from GDC and CGC and combined together all the metadata obtained from JSON and XML files. A thorough explanation of each metadata field is reported here.\nLet’s integrate all the metadata together. We have indeed access to a rich and comprehensive ensemble of clinical and sample metadata for the samples at hand.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCohort demographics\nLet’s check the overall demographic distributions of all the samples.\n\n\n\n\n\nDemographic overview\n\n\n\n\nWe notice that the ration between males and females included in the PanCan dataset is almost 1:1. As well, the age distributions for both sexes are very similar, and the averages of the two distributions almost overlap around 60 years old (59.4 years for female and 60.3 years for males). Race-wise, we have an over-representation of whites (73,4% of samples), followed by 12.0% of samples for which no race information is available. Blacks or african americans and asian represent a small percentage of the samples available, with 8.3% and 6.0% of the samples respectively.\n\n\nClinical overview\nLet’s check now the different cancer included in the study.\n\n\n\n\n\nClinical overview\n\n\n\n\nWe can check for any biases in terms of sex and ethnicity in the collected cancer samples. I would not expect any surprise here. Let’s see.\n\n\n\n\n\nClinical metadata breakdown by sex and ethnicity\n\n\n\n\nLastly, we can test how much … discrimination power gene expression filter lowly expressed genes selecte the top 1000 most variable genes By selecting the top 1,000 most variable genes we can see that there are clear differences between each cancer type, as captured by the UMAP.\n\n\n\n\n\nUMAP RNAseq",
