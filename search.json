    "text": "Abstract\n[[draft to improve]]\nCancer is a complex heterogeneous disease and challenges the identification of novel therapeutic targets. The complex relationships between DNA, transcripts and proteins captured by different single-omics approaches often fail to capture cancer complexity. Moreover, the non-linear relationships between DNA mutation, transcripts expression and protein abundances challenges the linear regression models often used in target discovery. Multi-omics integration can provide a better understanding of the heterogeneous nature of cancer and provide novel therapeutic targets.\nHere, I leverage public datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas program, TCGA. I will focus my efforts on Kidney Cancers: kidney chromophobe (KICH), kidney renal papillary cell carcinoma (KIRP), and kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC).\nFirst, we gonna explore how molecular differences between these three kidney cancers are captured and reflected in different single-omics layers (i.e.: transcriptomics, proteomics), and how linear multi-omics integration strategies deepen the biological insights.\nI will then dig into kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC) and develop a Deep Learning classifier to discriminate between the different KIRC consensus molecular subtypes. I will compare my method with existing molecular signatures based on transcriptomics data, and test if the new classifier can better classify samples from another cohort and best predict the clinical outcome of the patients.\nFinally, I will try to identify novel therapeutic targets based on my molecular subtypes.",

While Xena provides some information, it lacks a cleaned table containing all the demographic information of the subjects. Conveniently, GitHub user ipezoa already retrieved from GDC and CGC and combined together all the metadata obtained from JSON and XML files. A thorough explanation of each metadata field is reported here.\nLet’s integrate all the metadata together. We have indeed access to a rich and comprehensive ensemble of clinical and sample metadata for the samples at hand.\n\nCohort demographics\nLet’s check the overall demographic distributions of all the samples.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Demographic overview\n\n\n\n\nWe notice that the ration between males and females included in the PanCan dataset is almost 1:1. As well, the age distributions for both sexes are very similar, and the averages of the two distributions almost overlap around 60 years old (59.4 years for female and 60.3 years for males). Race-wise, we have an over-representation of whites (73,4% of samples), followed by 12.0% of samples for which no race information is available. Blacks or african americans and asian represent a small percentage of the samples available, with 8.3% and 6.0% of the samples respectively.\n\n\nClinical overview\nLet’s check now the different cancer included in the study.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Clinical overview\n\n\n\n\nWe can check for any biases in terms of sex and ethnicity in the collected cancer samples.

    "text": "1.2 Selection of Kidney samples\nFor the next sections, we will focus on kidney cancer. The choice is simply dictated by the abundance of samples which provide us a large playground to test different strategies for biomarker discovery, higher statistical power, and the existance of some Molecular Subtypes gene signatures that we can use as a benchmark and we can try to improve upon.\nLet’s select and explore the samples available for Kidney tissue.\n\n1.2.1 General Overview of the Dataset\nTo have a first overview of all the Kidney samples, we will plot a UMAP based on the gene expression of all the biopsys. A UMAP is an algorithm for dimension reduction based on manifold learning techniques and ideas from topological data analysis. The UMAP algorithm first constructs a weighted graph of the data in input (with N-dimensions), where the weight in the graph edge corresponds to how similar is a point (i.e.: sample) to the next one, and then projects this similarity graph into a bi-dimensional space. The 2-D projection is optimized to faithfully represents the relationships between the points in the N-dimensional space.\nTo build the UMAP, we focus on the 1,000 top most variable genes between the transcriptomics samples. This allows us to maximize similarities and differences between sample groups (if any).\nThe UMAP of all the samples divides the biopsys into 4 major clusters. Three clusters are localized on the upper part of the UMAP, and they loosely correspond to the three cancer subtypes in this cohort: kidney chromophobe (KICH), kidney renal papillary cell carcinoma (KIRP), and kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC). A further separation of the samples is visible on the y axis: biopsys from primary tumor are localized on top of the UMAP, while a second cluster of normal solid tissue are localized in the bottom of the UMAP, containing samples from non-diseased tissues of patients of all of the three cancer types.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Kidney UMAP - unfiltered data\n\n\n\n\nSince we want to focus on discovering new biomarkers for the three kidney cancer types, we will remove the biopsys from normal solid tissue. Then, we test if there is a strong imbalance between the sex and age of the subjects in the three kidney cancer cohorts, and wheter we should balance the cohorts or not.\n\n\n1.2.2 Cohort filtering\nFirst, we retain only biopsys from “Primary Tumor”, removing “Solid Tissue Normal” and “Additional - New Primary” neoplasis. Then we look at the distribution of age, sex and ethnicity in the three different cancer cohorts.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Kidney Cancer: demographic overview\n\n\n\n\nWe can immediatly see that the sampling biase towards patients with white background observed in all the cancer cohorts in Section 3.1 is reflected as well in kidney cancer cohorts. In terms of geneder demographics, males represents from 60% (KICH) to 74% (KIRP) of the cohorts. The histograms split by cancer types, however, show that the age distributions between the sexs int he different kidney cancer types are similar.\nSince we may loose too many samples if we would generate balanced cohorts in terms of sex and race, we can keep the samples as is, and take Age, Sex and Race in account during the modeling phases downstream.",

    "text": "1.3 Contingency tables\nAs we saw previously TCGA provides rich clinical metadata for each patient. We can run some simple demographic statistics (chi-squared and Fisher exact tests) to see if any clinical covariate is significantly overrepresented in any of the three cancer types.\nWe can test if there is a significant difference of each observed clinical covariate across the three kidney cancer types. The null hypothesis here is that the distribution of each covariate in the the three cancer subtypes is the same.\n\n1.3.1 Sex\nThere are 596 males and 291 females in the three kidney cancer cohorts after filtering. Despite the imbalance, the difference across cancer types is not significant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Contigency table, Sex\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.3.2 Disease status\nAfter filtering, the three kidney cancer types contains 563 subject that are now tumor free, and 190 subject that still have tumor. It seems that KIRP have significantly more patients that are now tumor free, while there are still significantly more patients with tumor for KIRC. The small sample size of KICH patients may skew these results, so this outcome should be interpreted with a pinch of salt.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Contigency table, Disease Status\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.3.3 Tumor Stages\nThe tumors across the patients were scored as: 458 Stage I, 105 Stage II, 189 Stage III and 105 Stage IV tumors.\nThis staging system is less granular than the TNM Staging System (that we look at into below), and it describe the tumro as follow:\n\nStage 0 = Abnormal cells are present but have not spread to nearby tissue. Also called carcinoma in situ, or CIS. CIS is not cancer, but it may become cancer.\nStage I, Stage II, and Stage III = Cancer is present. The higher the number, the larger the cancer tumor and the more it has spread into nearby tissues.\nStage IV = The cancer has spread to distant parts of the body.\n\nThe higher the number, the more advanced the cancer is.\nKIRC patients seem to have a higher number of Stage IV cancer, while KIRP patients have more STage I cancers. This can either be bias in the sampling of the cohort, or it could really indicate that KIRC cancer is more aggressive and fast progressing than KIRP.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Contigency table, Tumor Stage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.3.4 Tumor Histology\nHistological evaluation of the tumor cells essential to allow for accurate prognostication and tailored therapy, both surgical and adjuvant.\nHistological grade have five categories:\n\nG1 = Well differentiated\nG2 = Moderately differentiated\nG3 = Poorly differentiated, Undifferentiated, Anaplastic\nG4 = Undifferentiated (high grade)\nGX = Grade cannot be assessed\n\nUnfortunately, within the TCGA kidney cohorts, only KIRC biopsys where graded histologically. No histological grading was available for KICH and KIRP tumors.\nFor the KIRC tumors, 14 biopsys had G1 grade, 229 G2 grade, 204 had G3 grade, 76 G4 and 5 biopsys could not be graded (GX).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Contigency table, Tumor Histology\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.3.5 TMN, T: Main Tumor Pathology\nLet’s look now into the TMN staging system. We have multiple staging and substaging that describes the tumor presence, dimension and invasion of adjacent tissues:\n\nTX = Primary tumor cannot be assessed.\nT0 = No evidence of primary tumor.\nT1 = Tumor ≤2 cm in greatest dimension.\nT2 = Tumor &gt;2 cm but ≤4 cm.\nT3 = Tumor &gt;4 cm or with subserosal invasion or involvement of the mesoappendix.\nT4 = Tumor perforates the peritoneum or directly invades other adjacent organs or structures (excluding direct mural extension to adjacent subserosa of adjacent bowel), e.g., abdominal wall and skeletal muscle.\n\nThe presence of 12 distinct substaging for TMN, and the relative small sample size across the cohort makes the outcome of this comparison difficult to judge. We could claim that KIRP seems to be enriched in lower tumor stages (T1a) and depleted in higher tumor stages (T2, T3a, T3b) than KIRC.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Contigency table, TMN Main Tumor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.3.6 TMN, N: Lymph Nodes metastatis\nThe TMN tumor staging system provides as well a score for the lymph nodes:\n\nNX = Regional lymph nodes cannot be assessed.\nN0 = No regional lymph node metastasis.\nN1 = Regional lymph node metastasis &lt;12 nodes.\nN2 = Large mesenteric masses (&gt;2 cm) and/or extensive nodal deposits (≥12), especially those that encase the superior mesenteric vessels.\n\nIn the kidney cohort, lymph nodes of 506 patiens could not be scored (NX), 328 patients had a N0 score, 43 N1 and 7 had a N2 score. Lymph nodes of most patients with KIRP tumors could not be scored, they they were depleted in No and enriched in N1 if compared with patients with KIRC tumor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8: Contigency table, TMN Lymph nodes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.3.7 Prognosis Outcome\nOf the 887 petients with kidney tumor, 659 were alive at the time of the last check up, while 228 died. It appears that KIRC patients (48.7% dead) have worse prognosis than KIRP patients (17.9% dead), as observed in the previous comparisons. However, before drawing a formal conclusion, we should validate this observation at least in another independent cohort.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9: Contigency table, Vital Status",

In a transcriptomics dataset, the number of Principal Components equals the number of samples.\nThe PCA algorithm is run in an iterative manner: the first Principal Component is calculated by finding the line that maximizes the variance between the samples. The second Principal Component is calculated in the same way, with the condition that it is uncorrelated with (i.e., perpendicular to) the first principal component and that it accounts for the next highest variance. The third Principal Component is calculated in the same way, down to the last Principal Component.\nTo run PCA analyses on transcriptomics data, I recommend the PCAtools package by Kevin Blighe and Aaron Lun.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: PCA, exploration\n\n\n\n\nThe first 24 Principal Components capture more than 80% of the variance in the Kidney cancers transcriptomics dataset, with the first two components (PC1 and PC2) capturing a bit more than 25% of the variance.\nWhen we project the samples in the PC1 and PC2, we can see that the PC1 separates KIRC from KICH adn KIRP, which instead cluster together. The second component PC2, instead, seems to partially separate KICH and KIRP samples.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: PCA, biplot PC1 x PC2\n\n\n\n\nWe can also investigate other dimensions Principal Components, to see if there is a component that manages to fully resove the three cancer types. PC4 seems to separates better the KICH from KIRP, while PC1 can discriminate between KIRC and KIRP.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: PCA, pairs plots\n\n\n\n\nLet’s check the loadings (i.e.: 24 Principal Components capture more than 80% of the variance in the) for the top 4 Principal Components. These indicate which genes are the more responsible to explain the position of the samples along the components, and the direction of this separation.\nLooking at the top 1% most variable genes (~ 140 genes), the following 5 genes are the top loadings for the first 4 Principal Components:\n\nSPP1\nVIM\nFTL\nRGS5\nLOC96610\n\nLet’s now check the expression of the five top genes identified with the PCA across the cancer types:\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: PCA, loadings\n\n\n\n\nLet’s check the Pearson correlation with other clinical covariates.\nCertain histological and molecular subtyping correlates perfectly with PC4 (which discriminates KICH) immune infiltrating cells also correlates with PC1 and PC2, and may help to further characterize the subtypes and stratify patients\nAs we have learnt before (Section 1.3.7), KIRC patients seems to had a worse outcome than KIRP and to have tumors in more advanced stages. PC1 (computed from transcriptomics data) clearly separates KIRC and KIRP samples, and it correlates with tumor histological grade and stage, as well as clinical outcome. This show that we have good correlation between clinical observations and gene expression in Kidney cancers.\nSadly, no correlation between the top 5 components and the outcome of therapeutic care.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: PCA, correlations between clinical covariates and Principal Components",

DGE can help in identifying genes involved in a particular biological process, providing information on gene regulation and underlying biological mechanisms. One of the most used approaches to identify associations between genes and biological consist in applying generalized linear models, which aims to assign the variation in gene expression to each known variable in the experimental design, such as patient age, ethnicity, cancer type, treatment center taking care of the patients, etc.\nIn the section above we saw that age, ethnicity (and race) and age had somewhat a correlation with the cancer types. Therefore, we include this covariates in the differential gene expression analysis in order to take their contribution to gene expression variance into account.\nNow, we will compare the gene expression across the three different Kidney cancer types, and we will test the following pairwise comparisons for genes that are differentially expressed: KICH vs KIRC, KICH vs KIRP and KIRC vs KIRP.\n\n2.4.1 Identification of differentially expressed genes\nFor transcriptomics analyses, we use two arbitrary thresholds to retain genes that are significantly differentially expressed across the each comparison: an absolute logFold-Change (logFC) higher than 2, and an adjusted p-value lower than 0.05. This results in:\n\nKIRC_vs_KICH, 2,058 differentially expressed genes, 1,553 upregulated and 505 downregulated\nKIRP_vs_KICH, 1,567 differentially expressed genes, 1,101 upregulated and 466 downregulated\nKIRC_vs_KIRP, 739 differentially expressed genes, 570 upregulated and 169 downregulated\n\nThe relationships between how much a gene is differentially expressed (logFC) and its likelihood to be observed (p-value) in a DGE comparison is often visualized with a volcano plot, where each dot represent a gene. There are hundreds of genes that are differentially expressed across the biopsies of the three different kidney cancers in our cohorts.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8: Volcano plots of each contrats reporting the genes differentially expressed\n\n\n\n\nWe can also check the logFC and adjusted p-value for the top 5 genes that are the top loadings for the first 4 Principal Components and see how these genes were differentially expressed across the comparisons. We can confirm what we have naively observed at the level of gene counts in Figure 5 while investigating the PCA loadings: while these 5 genes have been suggested has the top loadings of the 2 Principal Components, FTL seems to do not have a large difference in expression across the three Kidney tumours.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can further dig into the hundreds of genes that are differentially expressed by looking at the overlaps between the upregulated and downregulated genes across the three DGE comparisons. The UpSet plot below facilitates visualizing these overlaps. As seen in the PCA, PC1 explain ~15% of the variability observed in the genes, and it separates KIRC from KICH and KIRP kidney cancer. We would then expect a large overlap between KIRC_vs_KIRP and KIRC_vs_KICH DE genes, however, we see instead that the largest overlaps between DE genes are between KIRC_vs_KICH and KIRP_vs_KICH comparisons. This suggest that KIRC and KIRP are more similar to each other than KICH, suggesting a more complex relationship than the one observed in the first two principal components.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9: UpSet reporting the genes differentially expressed upregulated and downregulated in common across all contrasts\n\n\n\n\nTables of differentially expressed genes.\n\nKIRC vs KICHKIRP vs KICHKIRC vs KIRP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.4.2 Comparative enrichment analyses across cancer types\nIn the next steps we further characterized the hundreds of genes that are differentially expressed across the three kidney cancers by performing a Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA). GSEA can identify whether specific pathways or molecular functions are upregulated or downregulated across the entire list of genes, providing insight into the biological differences at the gene expression levels between the three kidney cancers.\nWe will perform GSEA against an annotated set of gene ontologies and pathways:\n\nGene Ontology (GO). Gene Ontology provides a a comprehensive, computational model of biological systems and it is the world’s largest source of information on the functions of genes. It provides terms organized in three hierarchical ontologies (BP, CC and MF), that provide insights over gene Biological Processes (BP), Cellular Compartments (CC) and Molecular Functions (MF).\nKyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways (KEGG). KEGG is a database resource for understanding high-level functions and utilities of the biological system, such as the cell, the organism and the ecosystem, from molecular-level information. KEGG pathway is a collection of manually drawn pathway maps representing our knowledge of the molecular interaction, reaction and relation networks.\nReactome Pathways. Reactome is a free, open-source, curated and peer-reviewed pathway database.\nWikiPathways. WikiPathways is an open science platform for biological pathways contributed, updated, and used by the research community.\n\n\n2.4.2.1 GO Biological Process terms\nGene Ontology Biological Process are the larger processes or ‘biological programs’ accomplished by the concerted action of multiple molecular activities. Examples of broad BP terms are “DNA repair” or “signal transduction”. Examples of more specific terms are “cytosine biosynthetic process” or “D-glucose transmembrane transport”.\n\ndotplotterms mapgene mapGO terms clusters\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10: dotplot of enriched GO Biological Process terms\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11: Term maps reporting relationships between GO Biological Process across the different contrasts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12: gene maps reporting relationships between GO Biological Process enriched across the different contrasts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13: GO cluster heatmaps.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGiven the hundreds of genes in each contrast, hundreds of enriched GO BP terms have been identified across the three kidney cancer comparisons: 1,715 in KIRC_vs_KICH, 1,266 in KIRP_vs_KICH and 637 in KIRC_vs_KIRP. The dotplot reports on the most important term for each contrast, and based on this high-level overview we cannot really spot large differences across the three comparisons except for “regulation of T cell activation” that seems to be present only in KIRC_vs_KICH and not in the other contrasts.\nThe terms map provides an overview of the relationships between the most significant GO terms, and in which contrasts they appear. Each term is a colored circle, and each connection is a relationship of hierarchy between two terms. Each circle (term) is colored based on the contrast where it appears. Here, we can get a bit more insights in the differences between the three kidney cancers, but there is still an overwhelming abundance of information.\nA cluster of terms related to immune response, lymphocyte activation, differentiation and recruitment is clearly visible in the KIRC_vs_KICH and KIRP_vs_KICH comparisons, while it is absent in the contrast KIRC_vs_KIRP.\nThe gene map helps to further refine the genes annotated with the most significant GO terms. Genes are connected to the corresponding GO term, and coloured according to the contrasts that they belong to.\nInterpretation of the large amount of GO BP terms identified is difficult, given as well their similarity across the three contrasts. An option to increase interpretability is to cluster the GO terms based on their hierarchy and similarity. An elegant way to do so is to compute a distance matrix of the GO terms, and then perform a binary cut to identify GO terms clusters.\nThe rich GO cluster heatmap confirms that immune response and leucocyte activation terms are enriched in the KIRC_vs_KICH contrast when compared to KIRP_vs_KICH and KIRC_vs_KIRP. Also angiogenesis and development terms are clustered in two blocks that sees KIRC_vs_KICH in one side and KIRP_vs_KICH and KIRC_vs_KIRP on the other one. Ion transport and metabolic processes are more similar between KIRC_vs_KICH and KIRP_vs_KICH, and this could be a set of biological processes that are similarly disregulated in KIRC and KIRP.\nThe complete list of 2,632 GO BP terms enriched across the three contrasts is reported below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.4.2.2 GO Cellular Compartments terms\nGene Ontology Cellular Compartment serves to capture the cellular location where a molecular function takes place.\n\ndotplotterms mapgene mapGO terms clusters\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 14: dotplot of enriched GO Cellular Compartments terms\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15: Term maps reporting relationships between GO Cellular Compartments across the different contrasts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 16: gene maps reporting relationships between GO Cellular Compartments enriched across the different contrasts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 17: gene maps reporting relationships between GO Cellular Compartments enriched across the different contrasts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe terms dotplot and indicates that the enriched GO CC terms revolves around “plasma membrane”, “collagen” and the “extra-cellular matrix”, suggesting that most genes that are differentially expressed may be involved in transport across the plasma membrane and the remodeling of the extra-cellular matrix.\nThe terms map confirm this message, and in addition we have terms associated with “endocytic vesicles” and “MHC protein complexes” in KIRC_vs_KICH contrast, supporting the idea of a stronger T cell activation in KIRC.\nThe rich GO cluster heatmap shows that after clustering, most terms associated with plasma membrane and extra-cellular matrix remodeling are more abundant in KIRC_vs_KICH and KIRP_vs_KIRP, suggesting that extra-cellular matrix remodeling is more enhanced in KIRC, and may support a more Epithelial-Mesenchimal Transition (ETM) phenotype of this cancer.\nThe complete list of 218 GO CC terms enriched across the three contrasts is reported below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.4.2.3 GO Molecular Function terms\nGene Ontology Molecular Function serves to represent molecular-level activities performed by gene products.\n\ndotplotterms mapgene mapGO terms clusters\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 18: dotplot of enriched GO Molecular Functions terms\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 19: Term maps reporting relationships between GO Molecular Functions across the different contrasts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 20: gene maps reporting relationships between GO Molecular Functions enriched across the different contrasts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 21: gene maps reporting relationships between GO Molecular Functions enriched across the different contrasts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGiven the hundreds of genes in each contrast, hundreds of enriched GO BP terms have been identified across the three kidney cancer comparisons: 1,715 in KIRC_vs_KICH, 1,266 in KIRP_vs_KICH and 637 in KIRC_vs_KIRP.

This suggests that some kind of filtering was already applied during the preprocessing steps, together with scaling and normalization of the proteins spectral counts. The absence can therefore as well be ascribed to biological reasons as well, and not only to technical problems with its detection.\nTo preserve this putative biological signal, I replace in each sample the missing values with the minimum spectral count available in that sample.\nLet’s check how the spectral distributions changed.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Proteomics spectral counts after imputation",

Using these values, the proportion of methylation at each site CpG locus can be determined. The level of methylation at a locus is commonly reported as the Beta-value, i.e. the ratio of the methylated probe intensity and the overall intensity:\nbeta = M/(M/U)\nIllumina recommends adding a constant offset α (by default, α = 100) to the denominator to regularize Beta value when both methylated and unmethylated probe intensities are low. The Beta-value statistic results in a number between 0 and 1, or 0 and 100%. Under ideal conditions, a value of zero indicates that all copies of the CpG site in the sample were completely unmethylated (no methylated molecules were measured) and a value of one indicates that every copy of the site was methylated.\n\n5.3.1 Filtering & QC\nremoved 6364 probes with missing values\n148068-141704 [1] 6364\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: CNVs distributions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3.2 Dimesionality Reduction and Dataset Exploration\n\n5.3.2.1 UMAP on filtered transcriptomics data\nAfter we excluded biopsys from normal tissues and other tumors and we filtered out the lowly expressed genes, the UMAP shows three clusters that are better refined than the ones depicted in Section 1.2.1, and that roughly correspondes with three different kidney cancer subtypes.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Kidney UMAP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3.2.2 PCA\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: PCA, exploration\n\n\n\n\nThe first 24 Principal Components capture more than 80% of the variance in the Kidney cancers transcriptomics dataset, with the first two components (PC1 and PC2) capturing a bit more than 25% of the variance.\nWhen we project the samples in the PC1 and PC2, we can see that the PC1 separates KIRC from KICH adn KIRP, which instead cluster together.

Therefore, knowing whether several CpGs near to each other (or regions) are concordantly differentially methylated can be of greater interest.\nThere are several Bioconductor packages that have functions for identifying differentially methylated regions from 450k data. Some of the most popular are the dmrFind function in the charm package, which has been somewhat superseded for 450k arrays by the bumphunter function in minfi, and, the dmrcate in the DMRcate package. They are each based on different statistical methods, but we will be using dmrcate here, as it is based on limma and thus we can use the design and contrast matrix we defined earlier.\nWe will again start from our matrix of M-values. For this kind of analysis, this matrix has to be annotated with the chromosomal position of the CpGs and their gene annotations. Because in a first step the limma differential methylation analysis for single CpGs will be run again, we need to specify the design matrix, contrast matrix and contrast of interest.\nOnce we have the relevant statistics for the individual CpGs, we can then use the dmrcate function to combine them to identify differentially methylated regions. Of particular interest here is the lambda parameter; this value is the number of nucleotides that is allowed between significant CpGs before splitting them up in different regions. So a smaller lambda will result in more but smaller regions. For array data, the authors of the dmrcate package currently recommend a lambda of 1000. The main output table DMRs contains all of the regions found, along with their genomic annotations and p-values. To inspect this object and further visualization, you can best use the extractRanges function to create a GRanges object.\nDifferentially Methylated regions\nKIRC_vs_KICH: 20346 KIRP_vs_KICH: 19243 KIRC_vs_KIRP: 20773\nJust as for the single CpG analysis, it is a good idea to visually inspect the results to make sure they make sense. For this, use the DMR.plot function. By default, this plot draws the location of the DMR in the genome, the position of nearby genes, the positions of the CpG probes, the Beta value levels of each sample as a heatmap and the mean methylation levels for the various sample groups in the experiment.\n\n\n5.3.3.3 Functional Regions mCSEA\nAn alternative approach to detect DMRs is to predefine the regions to be tested; so, as opposed to the previous approach where the regions are defined according to heuristic distance rules we can define regions based on a shared function. For this, we will used the package mCSEA which contains three types of regions for 450K and EPIC arrays: promoter regions, gene body and CpG Islands. mCSEA is based on Gene Set Enrichment analysis (GSEA), a popular methodology for functional analysis that was specifically designed to avoid some drawbacks in the field of gene expression. Briefly, CpG sites are ranked according to a metric (logFC, t-statistic, …) and an enrichment score (ES) is calculated for each region. This is done by running through the entire ranked CpG list, increasing the score when a CpG in the region is encountered and decreasing the score when the gene encountered is not in the region. A high ES indicates these probes are found high up in the ranked list. In other words, a high (N)ES value means that for the CpG sites in this region there is - on average - a shift towards a higher methylation level. This approach has been shown to be more effective to detect smaller but consistent methylation differences.\n\nKIRC vs KICHKIRP vs KICHKIRC vs KIRP\n\n\npromoters\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngenes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n85promoters, 150 genes\n\n\n74 promoters 0 genes\npromoters\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngenes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n172 promoters, 50 genes\npromoters\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngenes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncc\n\n5.3.3.3.1 mCSEA Functional Enrichments\nLet’s see if any function is enriched in the genes of the Differentially Methilated Probes.

Then, we will add the weights for Factors 1, 2 and 3 that we have calculated with the Factor Analysis (Chapter 6) on the integrated multi-omics datasets (transcriptomics, miRNAs, proteomics and epigenomics). We compare the results and we see if adding info from the multi-omics lead to a model that predicts better the clinical outcome.\n\n7.2.1 Metadata only\nlet’s do it with metadat aonly first\n\n7.2.1.1 Kaplan Meier\nplot the survival\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: survival\n\n\n\n\ncompare survival plots\nlog rank test\nCall: survival::survdiff(formula = survival::Surv(OS.time, vital_status) ~ cancer_type, data = metadata)\nn=885, 2 observations deleted due to missingness.\n                    N Observed Expected (O-E)^2/E (O-E)^2/V\ncancer_type=TCGA-KICH 65 9 26.0 11.14 12.87 cancer_type=TCGA-KIRC 531 174 140.4 8.04 21.18 cancer_type=TCGA-KIRP 289 44 60.6 4.54 6.26\nChisq= 23.9 on 2 degrees of freedom, p= 6e-06\nAs noted on this page the term (O-E)^2/V is the basis for the log-rank test.\nTo know if the difference between the observed and expected events (O-E) for one group is significantly different from 0 (that is, the two groups have significantly different hazard functions), you need an estimate of the variance of that difference in the case (null hypothesis) that the groups have the same hazard function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.2.1.2 Cox regression model\nCox proportional hazards regression is one of the most popular regression techniques for survival analysis. Other models can also be used since the Cox model requires important assumptions that need to be verified for an appropriate use such as the proportional hazards assumption: see references.\nIn a Cox proportional hazards regression model, the measure of effect is the hazard rate (HR), which is the risk of failure (or the risk of death in our example), given that the participant has survived up to a specific time. Usually, we are interested in comparing independent groups with respect to their hazards, and we use a hazard ratio, which is analogous to an odds ratio in the setting of multiple logistic regression analysis. The cox.ph() function from the survival package is used to fit the model. The function cox.zph() from survival package may be used to test the proportional hazards assumption for a Cox regression model fit.\nNOTE: A probability must lie in the range 0 to 1. However, the hazard represents the expected number of events per one unit of time.\n\nIf the hazard ratio for a predictor is close to 1 then that predictor does not affect survival,\nif the HR is less than 1, then the predictor is protective (i.e., associated with improved survival),\nand if the HR is greater than 1, then the predictor is associated with increased risk (or decreased survival).\n\n[[[now we can add more covariates, but we have to check if the proportional hazard assumption holds true]]]\nIn another model we add more risk factors such as the source of infection and the number of days between date of onset and admission.

Other models can also be used since the Cox model requires important assumptions that need to be verified for an appropriate use such as the proportional hazards assumption: see references.\nIn a Cox proportional hazards regression model, the measure of effect is the hazard rate (HR), which is the risk of failure (or the risk of death in our example), given that the participant has survived up to a specific time. Usually, we are interested in comparing independent groups with respect to their hazards, and we use a hazard ratio, which is analogous to an odds ratio in the setting of multiple logistic regression analysis. The cox.ph() function from the survival package is used to fit the model. The function cox.zph() from survival package may be used to test the proportional hazards assumption for a Cox regression model fit.\nNOTE: A probability must lie in the range 0 to 1. However, the hazard represents the expected number of events per one unit of time.\n\nIf the hazard ratio for a predictor is close to 1 then that predictor does not affect survival,\nif the HR is less than 1, then the predictor is protective (i.e., associated with improved survival),\nand if the HR is greater than 1, then the predictor is associated with increased risk (or decreased survival).\n\n[[[now we can add more covariates, but we have to check if the proportional hazard assumption holds true]]]\nIn another model we add more risk factors such as the source of infection and the number of days between date of onset and admission. This time, we first verify the proportional hazards assumption before going forward.\nIn this model, we have included a continuous predictor (days_onset_hosp). In this case we interpret the parameter estimates as the increase in the expected log of the relative hazard for each one unit increase in the predictor, holding other predictors constant.
