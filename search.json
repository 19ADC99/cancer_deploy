From the Xena platform, we can find the data from Pan-Cancer Atlas consortium, which provides textbook high quality datasets that can be explored for target discovery in cancer.\nTCGA PanCan collects 12,839 samples from 28 organs, 69 primary sites spanning 32 different cancer types.\nThe metadata available for the samples and the subjects include:\nFor these samples, there are available rich clinical metadata and matched multiomics datasets.\nWe can retrieved the following multiomics readouts:\nAll the multiomics readouts are at the gene level, except for the DNA methylation data, that will have to be mapped and normalized at the gene level. Luckily, a mapping file is available as well.\nXena provides as well already precomputed enrichments and cell types deconvolutions:\nI assure you that integrating all these data will be fun, and it will provide deep insights on each cancer we decided to analyse.",

    "text": "1.2 Samples Overview\nNext step is to integrate together all the available sample and subjects metadata. This allows to break down the samples by cancer type and demographic distributions. While Xena provides some information, it lacks a cleaned table containing all the demographic information of the subjects. Conveniently, GitHub user ipezoa already retrieved from GDC and CGC and combined together all the metadata obtained from JSON and XML files. A thorough explanation of each metadata field is reported here.\nLet’s integrate all the metadata together. We have indeed access to a rich and comprehensive ensemble of clinical and sample metadata for the samples at hand.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2.1 Cohort demographics\nLet’s check the overall demographic distributions of all the samples.\n\n\n\n\n\nDemographic overview\n\n\n\n\nWe notice that the ration between males and females included in the PanCan dataset is almost 1:1. As well, the age distributions for both sexes are very similar, and the averages of the two distributions almost overlap around 60 years old (59.4 years for female and 60.3 years for males). Race-wise, we have an over-representation of whites (73,4% of samples), followed by 12.0% of samples for which no race information is available. Blacks or african americans and asian represent a small percentage of the samples available, with 8.3% and 6.0% of the samples respectively.\n\n\n1.2.2 Clinical overview\nLet’s check now the different cancer included in the study.\n\n\n\n\n\nClinical overview\n\n\n\n\nWe can check for any biases in terms of sex and ethnicity in the collected cancer samples. I would not expect any surprise here. Let’s see.\n\n\n\n\n\nClinical metadata breakdown by sex and ethnicity\n\n\n\n\nLastly, we can test how much … discrimination power gene expression filter lowly expressed genes selecte the top 1000 most variable genes By selecting the top 1,000 most variable genes we can see that there are clear differences between each cancer type, as captured by the UMAP.\n\n\n\n\n\nUMAP RNAseq",
