    "text": "Abstract\n[[rewrite]]\nThe complex and heterogeneous nature of cancer necessitates innovative approaches for effective target discovery and therapeutic development. Multiomics integration—combining genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolomic, and epigenomic data—has emerged as a transformative strategy in cancer research, significantly accelerating the identification of novel therapeutic targets. By leveraging the wealth of biological information from multiple layers of molecular data, researchers can gain comprehensive insights into tumor biology, elucidate underlying mechanisms of disease progression, and uncover potential vulnerabilities in cancer cells.\nRecent advancements in computational tools and methodologies have enabled the seamless integration of multiomics data. Techniques such as network analysis, machine learning, and pathway enrichment analysis facilitate the identification of key molecular interactions and regulatory networks that drive tumorigenesis (Duan et al., 2021; DOI: 10.1016/j.cell.2021.03.005). Furthermore, integrative approaches can reveal context-specific biomarkers and therapeutic targets that may be overlooked when examining individual omics datasets in isolation (Huang et al., 2020; DOI: 10.1038/s41598-020-64873-7).\nThe availability of public databases, such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Genomic Data Commons (GDC), and the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE), plays a crucial role in facilitating multiomics integration. These resources provide a rich repository of high-quality data, allowing researchers to validate findings across diverse cancer types and patient populations. The utilization of such publicly available data enhances the reproducibility and robustness of target discovery efforts while promoting collaborative research (Ghandi et al., 2019; DOI: 10.1038/s41586-019-0361-1).\nMoreover, multiomics integration enhances the identification of patient-specific therapeutic targets, paving the way for personalized medicine. By integrating patient-derived multiomics data, researchers can uncover unique tumor profiles that inform targeted treatment strategies, improving clinical outcomes (Berglund et al., 2020; DOI: 10.1016/j.cell.2020.09.034). The dynamic interplay between genetic alterations and their downstream effects on cellular pathways underscores the need for comprehensive multiomics analyses in cancer research.\nIn conclusion, the integration of multiomics data is revolutionizing cancer target discovery by providing a holistic view of tumor biology, enhancing our understanding of complex molecular interactions, and facilitating the identification of novel therapeutic strategies. The continued collaboration between public databases and cutting-edge analytical techniques will be pivotal in translating these discoveries into clinical applications, ultimately improving patient outcomes in cancer treatment.",

    "text": "Samples Overview\nNext step is to integrate together all the available sample and subjects metadata. This allows to break down the samples by cancer type and demographic distributions. While Xena provides some information, it lacks a cleaned table containing all the demographic information of the subjects. Conveniently, GitHub user ipezoa already retrieved from GDC and CGC and combined together all the metadata obtained from JSON and XML files. A thorough explanation of each metadata field is reported here.\nLet’s integrate all the metadata together. We have indeed access to a rich and comprehensive ensemble of clinical and sample metadata for the samples at hand.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCohort demographics\nLet’s check the overall demographic distributions of all the samples.\n\n\n\n\n\nDemographic overview\n\n\n\n\nWe notice that the ration between males and females included in the PanCan dataset is almost 1:1. As well, the age distributions for both sexes are very similar, and the averages of the two distributions almost overlap around 60 years old (59.4 years for female and 60.3 years for males). Race-wise, we have an over-representation of whites (73,4% of samples), followed by 12.0% of samples for which no race information is available. Blacks or african americans and asian represent a small percentage of the samples available, with 8.3% and 6.0% of the samples respectively.\n\n\nClinical overview\nLet’s check now the different cancer included in the study.\n\n\n\n\n\nClinical overview\n\n\n\n\nWe can check for any biases in terms of sex and ethnicity in the collected cancer samples. I would not expect any surprise here. Let’s see.\n\n\n\n\n\nClinical metadata breakdown by sex and ethnicity\n\n\n\n\nLastly, we can test how much … discrimination power gene expression filter lowly expressed genes selecte the top 1000 most variable genes By selecting the top 1,000 most variable genes we can see that there are clear differences between each cancer type, as captured by the UMAP.\n\n\n\n\n\nUMAP RNAseq\n\n\n\n\nThe UMAP show us that we can clearly clusters cancer types in distinct groups, and that we can identify clusters with related cancers (i.e.: colon-adenocarcinoma COAD and rectum-adenocarcinoma READ).",

    "text": "1.1.1 General Overview of the Dataset\nTo have a first overview of all the Kidney samples, we will plot a UMAP based on the gene expression of all the biopsys. A UMAP is an algorithm for dimension reduction based on manifold learning techniques and ideas from topological data analysis. I\n-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.- UMAP Explanation\nTo build the UMAP, we focus on the 1,000 top most variable genes between the transcriptomics samples. This allows us to maximize similarities and differences between sample groups (if any).\nThe UMAP of all the samples divides the biopsys into 4 major clusters. Three clusters are localized on the upper part of the UMAP, and they loosely correspond to the three cancer subtypes in this cohort: kidney chromophobe (KICH), kidney renal papillary cell carcinoma (KIRP), and kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC). A further separation of the samples is visible on the y axis: biopsys from primary tumor are localized on top of the UMAP, while a second cluster of normal solid tissue are localized in the bottom of the UMAP, containing samples from non-diseased tissues of patients of all of the three cancer types.\n\n\n\n\n\nKidney UMAP - unfiltered data\n\n\n\n\nSince we want to focus on discovering new biomarkers for the three kidney cancer types, we will remove the biopsys from normal solid tissue. Then, we test if there is a strong imbalance between the sex and age of the subjects in the three kidney cancer cohorts, and wheter we should balance the cohorts or not.\n\n\n1.1.2 Cohort filtering\nFirst, we retain only biopsys from “Primary Tumor”, removing “Solid Tissue Normal” and “Additional - New Primary” neoplasis. Then we look at the distribution of age, sex and ethnicity in the three different cancer cohorts.\n\n\n\n\n\nKidney Cancer: demographic overview\n\n\n\n\nWe can immediatly see that the sampling biase towards patients with white background observed in all the cancer cohorts in Section 2.1 is reflected as well in kidney cancer cohorts. In terms of geneder demographics, males represents from 60% (KICH) to 74% (KIRP) of the cohorts. The histograms split by cancer types, however, show that the age distributions between the sexs int he different kidney cancer types are similar.\nSince we may loose too many samples if we would generate balanced cohorts in terms of sex and race, we can keep the samples as is, and take Age, Sex and Race in account during the modeling phases downstream.",

    "text": "1.2 Contingency tables\nAs we saw previously TCGA provides rich clinical metadata for each patient. We can run some simple demographic statistics (chi-squared and Fisher exact tests) to see if any clinical covariate is significantly overrepresented in any of the three cancer types.\nWe can test if there is a significant difference of each observed clinical covariate across the three kidney cancer types. The null hypothesis here is that the distribution of each covariate in the the three cancer subtypes is the same.\n\n1.2.1 Sex\nThere are 596 males and 291 females in the three kidney cancer cohorts after filtering. Despite the imbalance, the difference across cancer types is not significant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContigency table: Sex\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2.2 Disease status\nAfter filtering, the three kidney cancer types contains 563 subject that are now tumor free, and 190 subject that still have tumor. It seems that KIRP have significantly more patients that are now tumor free, while there are still significantly more patients with tumor for KIRC. The small sample size of KICH patients may skew these results, so this outcome should be interpreted with a pinch of salt.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContigency table: Disease Status\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2.3 Tumor Stages\nThe tumors across the patients were scored as: 458 Stage I, 105 Stage II, 189 Stage III and 105 Stage IV tumors.\nThis staging system is less granular than the TNM Staging System (that we look at into below), and it describe the tumro as follow:\n\nStage 0 = Abnormal cells are present but have not spread to nearby tissue. Also called carcinoma in situ, or CIS. CIS is not cancer, but it may become cancer.\nStage I, Stage II, and Stage III = Cancer is present. The higher the number, the larger the cancer tumor and the more it has spread into nearby tissues.\nStage IV = The cancer has spread to distant parts of the body.\n\nThe higher the number, the more advanced the cancer is.\nKIRC patients seem to have a higher number of Stage IV cancer, while KIRP patients have more STage I cancers. This can either be bias in the sampling of the cohort, or it could really indicate that KIRC cancer is more aggressive and fast progressing than KIRP.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContigency table: Tumor Stage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2.4 Tumor Histology\nHistological evaluation of the tumor cells essential to allow for accurate prognostication and tailored therapy, both surgical and adjuvant.\nHistological grade have five categories:\n\nG1 = Well differentiated\nG2 = Moderately differentiated\nG3 = Poorly differentiated, Undifferentiated, Anaplastic\nG4 = Undifferentiated (high grade)\nGX = Grade cannot be assessed\n\nUnfortunately, within the TCGA kidney cohorts, only KIRC biopsys where graded histologically. No histological grading was available for KICH and KIRP tumors.\nFor the KIRC tumors, 14 biopsys had G1 grade, 229 G2 grade, 204 had G3 grade, 76 G4 and 5 biopsys could not be graded (GX).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContigency table: Tumor Histology\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2.5 TMN, T: Main Tumor Pathology\nLet’s look now into the TMN staging system. We have multiple staging and substaging that describes the tumor presence, dimension and invasion of adjacent tissues:\n\nTX = Primary tumor cannot be assessed.\nT0 = No evidence of primary tumor.\nT1 = Tumor ≤2 cm in greatest dimension.\nT2 = Tumor &gt;2 cm but ≤4 cm.\nT3 = Tumor &gt;4 cm or with subserosal invasion or involvement of the mesoappendix.\nT4 = Tumor perforates the peritoneum or directly invades other adjacent organs or structures (excluding direct mural extension to adjacent subserosa of adjacent bowel), e.g., abdominal wall and skeletal muscle.\n\nThe presence of 12 distinct substaging for TMN, and the relative small sample size across the cohort makes the outcome of this comparison difficult to judge. We could claim that KIRP seems to be enriched in lower tumor stages (T1a) and depleted in higher tumor stages (T2, T3a, T3b) than KIRC.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContigency table: TMN Main Tumor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2.6 TMN, N: Lymph Nodes metastatis\nThe TMN tumor staging system provides as well a score for the lymph nodes:\n\nNX = Regional lymph nodes cannot be assessed.\nN0 = No regional lymph node metastasis.\nN1 = Regional lymph node metastasis &lt;12 nodes.\nN2 = Large mesenteric masses (&gt;2 cm) and/or extensive nodal deposits (≥12), especially those that encase the superior mesenteric vessels.\n\nIn the kidney cohort, lymph nodes of 506 patiens could not be scored (NX), 328 patients had a N0 score, 43 N1 and 7 had a N2 score. Lymph nodes of most patients with KIRP tumors could not be scored, they they were depleted in No and enriched in N1 if compared with patients with KIRC tumor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContigency table: TMN Lymph nodes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2.7 Prognosis Outcome\nOf the 887 petients with kidney tumor, 659 were alive at the time of the last check up, while 228 died. It appears that KIRC patients (48.7% dead) have worse prognosis than KIRP patients (17.9% dead), as observed in the previous comparisons. However, before drawing a formal conclusion, we should validate this observation at least in another independent cohort.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContigency table: Sex",
