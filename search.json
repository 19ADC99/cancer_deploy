    "text": "Abstract\n[[draft to improve]]\nCancer is a complex heterogeneous disease and challenges the identification of novel therapeutic targets. The complex relationships between DNA, transcripts and proteins captured by different single-omics approaches often fail to capture cancer complexity. Moreover, the non-linear relationships between DNA mutation, transcripts expression and protein abundances challenges the linear regression models often used in target discovery. Multi-omics integration can provide a better understanding of the heterogeneous nature of cancer and provide novel therapeutic targets.\nHere, I leverage public datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas program, TCGA. I will focus my efforts on Kidney Cancers: kidney chromophobe (KICH), kidney renal papillary cell carcinoma (KIRP), and kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC).\nFirst, we gonna explore how molecular differences between these three kidney cancers are captured and reflected in different single-omics layers (i.e.: transcriptomics, proteomics), and how linear multi-omics integration strategies deepen the biological insights.\nI will then dig into kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC) and develop a Deep Learning classifier to discriminate between the different KIRC consensus molecular subtypes. I will compare my method with existing molecular signatures based on transcriptomics data, and test if the new classifier can better classify samples from another cohort and best predict the clinical outcome of the patients.\nFinally, I will try to identify novel therapeutic targets based on my molecular subtypes.",

    "text": "Samples Overview\nNext step is to integrate together all the available sample and subjects metadata. This allows to break down the samples by cancer type and demographic distributions. While Xena provides some information, it lacks a cleaned table containing all the demographic information of the subjects. Conveniently, GitHub user ipezoa already retrieved from GDC and CGC and combined together all the metadata obtained from JSON and XML files. A thorough explanation of each metadata field is reported here.\nLet’s integrate all the metadata together. We have indeed access to a rich and comprehensive ensemble of clinical and sample metadata for the samples at hand.\n\nCohort demographics\nLet’s check the overall demographic distributions of all the samples.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Demographic overview.\n\n\n\n\nWe notice that the ration between males and females included in the PanCan dataset is almost 1:1. As well, the age distributions for both sexes are very similar, and the averages of the two distributions almost overlap around 60 years old (59.4 years for female and 60.3 years for males). Race-wise, we have an over-representation of whites (73,4% of samples), followed by 12.0% of samples for which no race information is available. Blacks or african americans and asian represent a small percentage of the samples available, with 8.3% and 6.0% of the samples respectively.\n\n\nClinical overview\nLet’s check now the different cancer included in the study.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Clinical overview.\n\n\n\n\nWe can check for any biases in terms of sex and ethnicity in the collected cancer samples. I would not expect any surprise here. Let’s see.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Clinical metadata breakdown by sex and ethnicity.\n\n\n\n\nLastly, we can test how much … discrimination power gene expression filter lowly expressed genes selecte the top 1000 most variable genes By selecting the top 1,000 most variable genes we can see that there are clear differences between each cancer type, as captured by the UMAP.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: UMAP RNAseq.\n\n\n\n\nThe UMAP show us that we can clearly clusters cancer types in distinct groups, and that we can identify clusters with related cancers (i.e.: colon-adenocarcinoma COAD and rectum-adenocarcinoma READ).",

    "text": "1.2 Selection of Kidney samples\nFor the next sections, we will focus on kidney cancer. The choice is simply dictated by the abundance of samples which provide us a large playground to test different strategies for biomarker discovery, higher statistical power, and the existance of some Molecular Subtypes gene signatures that we can use as a benchmark and we can try to improve upon.\nLet’s select and explore the samples available for Kidney tissue.\n\n1.2.1 General Overview of the Dataset\nTo have a first overview of all the Kidney samples, we will plot a UMAP based on the gene expression of all the biopsys. A UMAP is an algorithm for dimension reduction based on manifold learning techniques and ideas from topological data analysis. The UMAP algorithm first constructs a weighted graph of the data in input (with N-dimensions), where the weight in the graph edge corresponds to how similar is a point (i.e.: sample) to the next one, and then projects this similarity graph into a bi-dimensional space. The 2-D projection is optimized to faithfully represents the relationships between the points in the N-dimensional space.\nTo build the UMAP, we focus on the 1,000 top most variable genes between the transcriptomics samples. This allows us to maximize similarities and differences between sample groups (if any).\nThe UMAP of all the samples divides the biopsys into 4 major clusters. Three clusters are localized on the upper part of the UMAP, and they loosely correspond to the three cancer subtypes in this cohort: kidney chromophobe (KICH), kidney renal papillary cell carcinoma (KIRP), and kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC). A further separation of the samples is visible on the y axis: biopsys from primary tumor are localized on top of the UMAP, while a second cluster of normal solid tissue are localized in the bottom of the UMAP, containing samples from non-diseased tissues of patients of all of the three cancer types.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Kidney UMAP - unfiltered data.\n\n\n\n\nSince we want to focus on discovering new biomarkers for the three kidney cancer types, we will remove the biopsys from normal solid tissue. Then, we test if there is a strong imbalance between the sex and age of the subjects in the three kidney cancer cohorts, and wheter we should balance the cohorts or not.\n\n\n1.2.2 Cohort filtering\nFirst, we retain only biopsys from “Primary Tumor”, removing “Solid Tissue Normal” and “Additional - New Primary” neoplasis. Then we look at the distribution of age, sex and ethnicity in the three different cancer cohorts.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Kidney Cancer: demographic overview.\n\n\n\n\nWe can immediatly see that the sampling biase towards patients with white background observed in all the cancer cohorts in Section 3.1 is reflected as well in kidney cancer cohorts. In terms of geneder demographics, males represents from 60% (KICH) to 74% (KIRP) of the cohorts. The histograms split by cancer types, however, show that the age distributions between the sexs int he different kidney cancer types are similar.\nSince we may loose too many samples if we would generate balanced cohorts in terms of sex and race, we can keep the samples as is, and take Age, Sex and Race in account during the modeling phases downstream.",

    "text": "1.3 Contingency tables\nAs we saw previously TCGA provides rich clinical metadata for each patient. We can run some simple demographic statistics (chi-squared and Fisher exact tests) to see if any clinical covariate is significantly overrepresented in any of the three cancer types.\nWe can test if there is a significant difference of each observed clinical covariate across the three kidney cancer types. The null hypothesis here is that the distribution of each covariate in the the three cancer subtypes is the same.\n\n1.3.1 Sex\nThere are 596 males and 291 females in the three kidney cancer cohorts after filtering. Despite the imbalance, the difference across cancer types is not significant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Contigency table, Sex.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.3.2 Disease status\nAfter filtering, the three kidney cancer types contains 563 subject that are now tumor free, and 190 subject that still have tumor. It seems that KIRP have significantly more patients that are now tumor free, while there are still significantly more patients with tumor for KIRC. The small sample size of KICH patients may skew these results, so this outcome should be interpreted with a pinch of salt.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Contigency table, Disease Status.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.3.3 Tumor Stages\nThe tumors across the patients were scored as: 458 Stage I, 105 Stage II, 189 Stage III and 105 Stage IV tumors.\nThis staging system is less granular than the TNM Staging System (that we look at into below), and it describe the tumro as follow:\n\nStage 0 = Abnormal cells are present but have not spread to nearby tissue. Also called carcinoma in situ, or CIS. CIS is not cancer, but it may become cancer.\nStage I, Stage II, and Stage III = Cancer is present. The higher the number, the larger the cancer tumor and the more it has spread into nearby tissues.\nStage IV = The cancer has spread to distant parts of the body.\n\nThe higher the number, the more advanced the cancer is.\nKIRC patients seem to have a higher number of Stage IV cancer, while KIRP patients have more STage I cancers. This can either be bias in the sampling of the cohort, or it could really indicate that KIRC cancer is more aggressive and fast progressing than KIRP.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Contigency table, Tumor Stage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.3.4 Tumor Histology\nHistological evaluation of the tumor cells essential to allow for accurate prognostication and tailored therapy, both surgical and adjuvant.\nHistological grade have five categories:\n\nG1 = Well differentiated\nG2 = Moderately differentiated\nG3 = Poorly differentiated, Undifferentiated, Anaplastic\nG4 = Undifferentiated (high grade)\nGX = Grade cannot be assessed\n\nUnfortunately, within the TCGA kidney cohorts, only KIRC biopsys where graded histologically. No histological grading was available for KICH and KIRP tumors.\nFor the KIRC tumors, 14 biopsys had G1 grade, 229 G2 grade, 204 had G3 grade, 76 G4 and 5 biopsys could not be graded (GX).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Contigency table, Tumor Histology.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.3.5 TMN, T: Main Tumor Pathology\nLet’s look now into the TMN staging system. We have multiple staging and substaging that describes the tumor presence, dimension and invasion of adjacent tissues:\n\nTX = Primary tumor cannot be assessed.\nT0 = No evidence of primary tumor.\nT1 = Tumor ≤2 cm in greatest dimension.\nT2 = Tumor &gt;2 cm but ≤4 cm.\nT3 = Tumor &gt;4 cm or with subserosal invasion or involvement of the mesoappendix.\nT4 = Tumor perforates the peritoneum or directly invades other adjacent organs or structures (excluding direct mural extension to adjacent subserosa of adjacent bowel), e.g., abdominal wall and skeletal muscle.\n\nThe presence of 12 distinct substaging for TMN, and the relative small sample size across the cohort makes the outcome of this comparison difficult to judge. We could claim that KIRP seems to be enriched in lower tumor stages (T1a) and depleted in higher tumor stages (T2, T3a, T3b) than KIRC.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Contigency table, TMN Main Tumor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.3.6 TMN, N: Lymph Nodes metastatis\nThe TMN tumor staging system provides as well a score for the lymph nodes:\n\nNX = Regional lymph nodes cannot be assessed.\nN0 = No regional lymph node metastasis.\nN1 = Regional lymph node metastasis &lt;12 nodes.\nN2 = Large mesenteric masses (&gt;2 cm) and/or extensive nodal deposits (≥12), especially those that encase the superior mesenteric vessels.\n\nIn the kidney cohort, lymph nodes of 506 patiens could not be scored (NX), 328 patients had a N0 score, 43 N1 and 7 had a N2 score. Lymph nodes of most patients with KIRP tumors could not be scored, they they were depleted in No and enriched in N1 if compared with patients with KIRC tumor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8: Contigency table, TMN Lymph nodes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.3.7 Prognosis Outcome\nOf the 887 petients with kidney tumor, 659 were alive at the time of the last check up, while 228 died. It appears that KIRC patients (48.7% dead) have worse prognosis than KIRP patients (17.9% dead), as observed in the previous comparisons. However, before drawing a formal conclusion, we should validate this observation at least in another independent cohort.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9: Contigency table, Vital Status.",

The graph below reports the density curves of gene expressions (logCPM) before and after filtering of lowly expressed genes. Each line represent a sample. Before filtering, all samples showed a left-hand side shoulder, with a peak below 0 logCPM higher than a second peak centered around 5 logCPM.

In a transcriptomics dataset, the number of Principal Components equals the number of samples.\nThe PCA algorithm is run in an iterative manner: the first Principal Component is calculated by finding the line that maximizes the variance between the samples. The second Principal Component is calculated in the same way, with the condition that it is uncorrelated with (i.e., perpendicular to) the first principal component and that it accounts for the next highest variance. The third Principal Component is calculated in the same way, down to the last Principal Component.\nTo run PCA analyses on transcriptomics data, I recommend the PCAtools package by Kevin Blighe and Aaron Lun.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: PCA, exploration.\n\n\n\n\nThe first 24 Principal Components capture more than 80% of the variance in the Kidney cancers transcriptomics dataset, with the first two components (PC1 and PC2) capturing a bit more than 25% of the variance.\nWhen we project the samples in the PC1 and PC2, we can see that the PC1 separates KIRC from KICH adn KIRP, which instead cluster together. The second component PC2, instead, seems to partially separate KICH and KIRP samples.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: PCA, biplot PC1 x PC2.\n\n\n\n\nWe can also investigate other dimensions Principal Components, to see if there is a component that manages to fully resove the three cancer types. PC4 seems to separates better the KICH from KIRP, while PC1 can discriminate between KIRC and KIRP.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: PCA, pairs plots.\n\n\n\n\nLet’s check the loadings (i.e.: 24 Principal Components capture more than 80% of the variance in the) for the top 4 Principal Components. These indicate which genes are the more responsible to explain the position of the samples along the components, and the direction of this separation.\nLooking at the top 1% most variable genes (~ 140 genes), the following 5 genes are the top loadings for the first 4 Principal Components:\n\nSPP1\nVIM\nFTL\nRGS5\nLOC96610\n\nLet’s now check the expression of the five top genes identified with the PCA across the cancer types:\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: PCA, loadings.\n\n\n\n\nLet’s check the Pearson correlation with other clinical covariates.\nCertain histological and molecular subtyping correlates perfectly with PC4 (which discriminates KICH) immune infiltrating cells also correlates with PC1 and PC2, and may help to further characterize the subtypes and stratify patients\nAs we have learnt before (Section 1.3.7), KIRC patients seems to had a worse outcome than KIRP and to have tumors in more advanced stages. PC1 (computed from transcriptomics data) clearly separates KIRC and KIRP samples, and it correlates with tumor histological grade and stage, as well as clinical outcome. This show that we have good correlation between clinical observations and gene expression in Kidney cancers.\nSadly, no correlation between the top 5 components and the outcome of therapeutic care.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: PCA, correlations between clinical covariates and Principal Components.",

    "section": "2.4 Differential gene expression analysis",
    "text": "2.4 Differential gene expression analysis\nDifferential gene expression (DGE) analysis is used compare gene expression levels between two or more sample groups, in this case, Kidney cancer types. DGE can help in identifying genes involved in a particular biological process, providing information on gene regulation and underlying biological mechanisms. One of the most used approaches to identify associations between genes and biological consist in applying generalized linear models, which aims to assign the variation in gene expression to each known variable in the experimental design, such as patient age, ethnicity, cancer type, treatment center taking care of the patients, etc.\nIn the section above we saw that age, ethnicity (and race) and age had somewhat a correlation with the cancer types. Therefore, we include this covariates in the differential gene expression analysis in order to take their contribution to gene expression variance into account.\nNow, we will compare the gene expression across the three different Kidney cancer types, and we will test the following pairwise comparisons for genes that are differentially expressed: KICH vs KIRC, KICH vs KIRP and KIRC vs KIRP.\n\n2.4.1 Identification of differentially expressed genes\nFor transcriptomics analyses, we use two arbitrary thresholds to retain genes that are significantly differentially expressed across the each comparison: an absolute logFold-Change (logFC) higher than 2, and an adjusted p-value lower than 0.05. This results in:\n\nKIRC_vs_KICH, 2,058 differentially expressed genes, 1,553 upregulated and 505 downregulated\nKIRP_vs_KICH, 1,567 differentially expressed genes, 1,101 upregulated and 466 downregulated\nKIRC_vs_KIRP, 739 differentially expressed genes, 570 upregulated and 169 downregulated\n\nThe relationships between how much a gene is differentially expressed (logFC) and its likelihood to be observed (p-value) in a DGE comparison is often visualized with a volcano plot, where each dot represent a gene. There are hundreds of genes that are differentially expressed across the biopsies of the three different kidney cancers in our cohorts.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8: Volcano plots of each contrats reporting the genes differentially expressed.\n\n\n\n\nWe can also check the logFC and adjusted p-value for the top 5 genes that are the top loadings for the first 4 Principal Components and see how these genes were differentially expressed across the comparisons. We can confirm what we have naively observed at the level of gene counts in Figure 6 while investigating the PCA loadings: while these 5 genes have been suggested has the top loadings of the 2 Principal Components, FTL seems to do not have a large difference in expression across the three Kidney tumours.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can further dig into the hundreds of genes that are differentially expressed by looking at the overlaps between the upregulated and downregulated genes across the three DGE comparisons. The UpSet plot below facilitates visualizing these overlaps. As seen in the PCA, PC1 explain ~15% of the variability observed in the genes, and it separates KIRC from KICH and KIRP kidney cancer. We would then expect a large overlap between KIRC_vs_KIRP and KIRC_vs_KICH DE genes, however, we see instead that the largest overlaps between DE genes are between KIRC_vs_KICH and KIRP_vs_KICH comparisons. This suggest that KIRC and KIRP are more similar to each other than KICH, suggesting a more complex relationship than the one observed in the first two principal components.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9: UpSet reporting the genes differentially expressed upregulated and downregulated in common across all contrasts.\n\n\n\n\nTables of differentially expressed genes.\n\nKIRC vs KICHKIRP vs KICHKIRC vs KIRP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.4.2 Comparative enrichment analyses across cancer types\nIn the next steps we further characterized the hundreds of genes that are differentially expressed across the three kidney cancers by performing a Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA). GSEA can identify whether specific pathways or molecular functions are upregulated or downregulated across the entire list of genes, providing insight into the biological differences at the gene expression levels between the three kidney cancers.\nWe will perform GSEA against an annotated set of gene ontologies and pathways:\n\nGene Ontology (GO). Gene Ontology provides a a comprehensive, computational model of biological systems and it is the world’s largest source of information on the functions of genes. It provides terms organized in three hierarchical ontologies (BP, CC and MF), that provide insights over gene Biological Processes (BP), Cellular Compartments (CC) and Molecular Functions (MF).\nKyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways (KEGG). KEGG is a database resource for understanding high-level functions and utilities of the biological system, such as the cell, the organism and the ecosystem, from molecular-level information. KEGG pathway is a collection of manually drawn pathway maps representing our knowledge of the molecular interaction, reaction and relation networks.\nReactome Pathways. Reactome is a free, open-source, curated and peer-reviewed pathway database.\nWikiPathways. WikiPathways is an open science platform for biological pathways contributed, updated, and used by the research community.\n\n\n2.4.2.1 GO Biological Process terms\nGene Ontology Biological Process are the larger processes or ‘biological programs’ accomplished by the concerted action of multiple molecular activities. Examples of broad BP terms are “DNA repair” or “signal transduction”. Examples of more specific terms are “cytosine biosynthetic process” or “D-glucose transmembrane transport”.\n\ndotplotterms mapgene mapGO terms clusters\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10: dotplot of enriched GO Biological Process terms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11: Term maps reporting relationships between GO Biological Process across the different contrasts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12: gene maps reporting relationships between GO Biological Process enriched across the different contrasts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13: GO cluster heatmaps.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGiven the hundreds of genes in each contrast, hundreds of enriched GO BP terms have been identified across the three kidney cancer comparisons: 1,715 in KIRC_vs_KICH, 1,266 in KIRP_vs_KICH and 637 in KIRC_vs_KIRP. The dotplot reports on the most important term for each contrast, and based on this high-level overview we cannot really spot large differences across the three comparisons except for “regulation of T cell activation” that seems to be present only in KIRC_vs_KICH and not in the other contrasts.\nThe terms map provides an overview of the relationships between the most significant GO terms, and in which contrasts they appear. Each term is a colored circle, and each connection is a relationship of hierarchy between two terms. Each circle (term) is colored based on the contrast where it appears. Here, we can get a bit more insights in the differences between the three kidney cancers, but there is still an overwhelming abundance of information.\nA cluster of terms related to immune response, lymphocyte activation, differentiation and recruitment is clearly visible in the KIRC_vs_KICH and KIRP_vs_KICH comparisons, while it is absent in the contrast KIRC_vs_KIRP.\nThe gene map helps to further refine the genes annotated with the most significant GO terms. Genes are connected to the corresponding GO term, and coloured according to the contrasts that they belong to.\nInterpretation of the large amount of GO BP terms identified is difficult, given as well their similarity across the three contrasts. An option to increase interpretability is to cluster the GO terms based on their hierarchy and similarity. An elegant way to do so is to compute a distance matrix of the GO terms, and then perform a binary cut to identify GO terms clusters.\nThe rich GO cluster heatmap confirms that immune response and leucocyte activation terms are enriched in the KIRC_vs_KICH contrast when compared to KIRP_vs_KICH and KIRC_vs_KIRP. Also angiogenesis and development terms are clustered in two blocks that sees KIRC_vs_KICH in one side and KIRP_vs_KICH and KIRC_vs_KIRP on the other one. Ion transport and metabolic processes are more similar between KIRC_vs_KICH and KIRP_vs_KICH, and this could be a set of biological processes that are similarly disregulated in KIRC and KIRP.\nThe complete list of 2,632 GO BP terms enriched across the three contrasts is reported below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.4.2.2 GO Cellular Compartments terms\nGene Ontology Cellular Compartment serves to capture the cellular location where a molecular function takes place.\n\ndotplotterms mapgene mapGO terms clusters\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 14: dotplot of enriched GO Cellular Compartments terms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15: Term maps reporting relationships between GO Cellular Compartments across the different contrasts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 16: gene maps reporting relationships between GO Cellular Compartments enriched across the different contrasts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 17: gene maps reporting relationships between GO Cellular Compartments enriched across the different contrasts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe terms dotplot and indicates that the enriched GO CC terms revolves around “plasma membrane”, “collagen” and the “extra-cellular matrix”, suggesting that most genes that are differentially expressed may be involved in transport across the plasma membrane and the remodeling of the extra-cellular matrix.\nThe terms map confirm this message, and in addition we have terms associated with “endocytic vesicles” and “MHC protein complexes” in KIRC_vs_KICH contrast, supporting the idea of a stronger T cell activation in KIRC.\nThe rich GO cluster heatmap shows that after clustering, most terms associated with plasma membrane and extra-cellular matrix remodeling are more abundant in KIRC_vs_KICH and KIRP_vs_KIRP, suggesting that extra-cellular matrix remodeling is more enhanced in KIRC, and may support a more Epithelial-Mesenchimal Transition (ETM) phenotype of this cancer.\nThe complete list of 218 GO CC terms enriched across the three contrasts is reported below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.4.2.3 GO Molecular Function terms\nGene Ontology Molecular Function serves to represent molecular-level activities performed by gene products.\n\ndotplotterms mapgene mapGO terms clusters\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 18: dotplot of enriched GO Molecular Functions terms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 19: Term maps reporting relationships between GO Molecular Functions across the different contrasts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 20: gene maps reporting relationships between GO Molecular Functions enriched across the different contrasts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 21: gene maps reporting relationships between GO Molecular Functions enriched across the different contrasts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe GO MF terms map and terms cluster suggest clear differences that discriminates KIRC and KICH tumors. KIRC and KIRP seem to have enriched terms on metabolism and strong transporter activities (i.e.: “solute:monoatomic cation symporter activity”, “solute:sodium symporter activity”) when compared to KICH, suggesting that these two kidney cancers are metabolically more active. KIRC instead have enriched GO MF terms associated with remodelling of the extracellular matrix (e.g.: “extracellular matrix structural constituent”, “collagen binding”), receptor activity and chemokine binding (e.g.: “G protein-coupled receptor binding”, “cytokine binding”), suggesting a more hot type of tumor with active recruitment and infiltration of immune cells, when compared to KIRP and KICH.\nThe complete list of 316 GO MF terms enriched across the three contrasts is reported below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.4.2.4 KEGG pathways\nKEGG pathways are manually curated and capture our knowledge of the molecular interaction, reaction and relation networks.\n\ndotplotterms mapgene map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 22: dotplot of enriched KEGG pathways.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 23: Term maps reporting relationships between KEGG pathways enriched across the different contrasts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 24: gene maps reporting relationships between KEGG pathways enriched across the different contrasts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe signal captured in the enriched KEGG pathways seems less clear than the one identified across the enriched GO terms, but in general, the terms maps provide a story in line to what described with the enriched GO terms. KIRC present a stronger immune response when compared to KIRP and KICH (i.e.: “Th1 and Th2 cell differentiation”, “Th17 cell differentiation”, “Hematopoietic cell lineage”) and extracellular matrix remodelling / epithelial-to-mesenchimal transition (e.g.: “Rap1 signaling pathway”).\nThe complete list of 95 KEGG pathways across the three contrasts is reported below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.4.2.5 Reactome pathways\nSimilarly to KEGG, Reactome pathways are manually curated biological pathways.\n\ndotplotterms mapgene map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 25: dotplot of enriched Reactome pathways.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 26: Term maps reporting relationships between Reactome pathways enriched across the different contrasts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 27: gene maps reporting relationships between Reactome pathways enriched across the different contrasts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe enriched Reactome pathways are concordant to what emerged so far of the differences and similaritiesof the expression profiles of KIRC, KIRP and KICH kidney carcinomas.

    "text": "2.5 Infiltrating immune cells\nThe Gene Set Enrichment Analyses (Section 2.4.2) revealed that immune response and immune cells infiltration is an emerging biological theme in KIRC when compared to KIRP and KICH kidney carcinomas. While for TCGA we do not have single-cell datasets that would allow for a precise quantification and characterization of the tumor micro-environment, we can get an approximate view of the differences in infiltrating immune cells between the three kidney carcinomas by looking at bulk RNA-seq cellular deconvolution techniques.\nFor this, I will use the R package infiltR, which includes three common bulk RNA-seq deconvolution tools for quantification of tumor-infiltrating immune cells:\n\nCIBERSORT;\nMCP-counter;\nquanTIseq.\n\ninfiltR uses MCP-counter to obtain absolute quantification of infiltrating immune cells, while a more detailed profiling of relative immune cells subtypes is performed with CIBERSORT and quanTIseq.\nLet’s look at the main output of the infiltR predictions:\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 31: Infiltraing immune cells estimates.\n\n\n\n\nOn the top panel we have the absolute quantification as estimated by MCP-counter, while in the bottom panel we have the relative quantification based on CIBERSORT, MCP-counter and quanTIseq. The emerging picture on the infilatring immune cells is consistent with the enriched pathways we have identified with the GSEA analysis:\n\nKICH: KICH appears like a “cold” tumor, with less infiltrating immune cells, if compared to KIRC and KIRP. Limited immune engagement may limit the number of possible immune-therapeutic targets.\n\nKICH has less absolute number of infiltrating immune cells than KIRC, and similar to KIRP.\nKICH has more T CD4 memory cells and less Tregs fractions than KIRC and KIRP.\nKICH has less Neutrophils, Monocytes and Macrophages fractions than KIRC and KIRP.\n\nKIRC: KIRC appears to have a high amount of infiltrating immune cells. The proportion between CD8 T cells and Tregs may indicate an immune-inflamed but immunosuppressed microenvironment, supported as well by the presence of monocytes and macrophages\n\nKIRC has the highest count of total infiltrating immune cells, and the highest count of CD8 T cells.\nKIRC has the highest fraction of CD8 T cells and Tregs.\nKIRC has the highest fraction of infiltrating monocytes and macrophages M1, and high fraction of Macrophages 2 and Dendritic cells.\n\nKIRP: KIRP appears to have an immature macrophage population in the tumor microenvironment. These M0 macrophages may polarize into either M1 (pro-inflammatory) or M2 (immunosuppressive).\n\nKIRP has an absolute count of infiltrating immune cells comparable to KICH.\nKIRP cell fractions contains the highest Macrophages M0, Macrophages M2 and Dendritic cells resting.\nKIRP cell fraction contains high Tregs.\n\n\nIn Figure 31 we can spot some discrepancies between the predicted infiltrating immune cells proportion across the different methods. infiltR allows as well to compare check the concordance between different estimates, by performing a pairwise aggregation the immune cell types and compare them across couples of methods.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 32: Concordance between different estimates.\n\n\n\n\nThe sanity-check plot in Figure 32 reveals that except for the CD8 T cells estimates, the estimates of the three methods have poor correlation. This can be ascribed to the different underlying algorithms for the three different methods, with different assumptions, strengths and weaknesses. Moreover, the overall overlap between cell types detected (more granular for CIBERSORT, more general for MCP-counter) is low, and infiltR aggregation to the minimum-common denominator to perform the comparison may enhance the discrepancy between the methodologies.",

    "text": "3.2 Proteomics data overview and QC\n\n3.2.1 Spectral counts overview\nFor TCGA Kidney cancer proteomics data, we will perform analyses similar to the ones performed for the transcriptomics one (see Chapter 2). We first start with an overview of the datasets and QC.\nLet’s check the spectral counts distributions across samples, and the protein completeness across samples.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Proteomics spectral counts missing values.\n\n\n\n\nLooking at the distributions, we can conclude that the spectral intensities were already normalized and scaled, since the spectral values are centered around 0 and have a normal distribution.\nWe have 258 proteins in total, across 709 samples (79.9% of samples had proteomics data).\n\n24 proteins were missing in all samples (100% of patients with proteomics data available)\n1 protein was missing in 440 samples (62.1% of patients with proteomics data available)\n16 proteins were missing in 269 samples (37.9% of patients with proteomics data available)\n6 protein were missing in only 1 sample 211 proteins were detected for all patients with proteomics data available)\n\nWe can obviously drop the 24 proteins for which we have not spectral counts for none of the samples. For the remaining proteins for which we do not have full occupancy, we will apply a standard imputation strategy.\n\n\n3.2.2 Data imputation\nMissing values imputation for label-free proteomics is a large and complex field of study.\nIn our Kidney cancer proteomics samples the number of proteins detected is small and the distribution of missing values is oddly discrete. This suggests that some kind of filtering was already applied during the preprocessing steps, together with scaling and normalization of the proteins spectral counts. The absence can therefore as well be ascribed to biological reasons as well, and not only to technical problems with its detection.\nTo preserve this putative biological signal, I replace in each sample the missing values with the minimum spectral count available in that sample.\nLet’s check how the spectral distributions changed.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Proteomics spectral counts after imputation.",

We have almost a perfect clustering of the samples in their corresponding cancer subtypes, with just 2 KICH samples clusting with KIRC samples.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Kidney proteomics UMAP.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3.2 Principal Component Analysis (PCA)\nAs we did for the transcriptomics data (see Chapter 2), the next step in the dataset exploration is to perform the Principal Component Analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: PCA, exploration.\n\n\n\n\nThe first 21 Principal Components capture more than 80% of the variance in the Kidney cancers transcriptomics dataset, with the first two components (PC1 and PC2) capturing a bit more than 40% of the variance.\nWhen we project the samples in the PC1 and PC2, we can see that the PC1 separates KIRC from KICH and KIRP, which instead cluster together. The second component PC2, instead, seems to separate KICH and KIRP samples. The separation between KICH and KIRP samples along component PC2 is clearer in the proteomics data than in the transcriptomics data.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: PCA, biplot PC1 x PC2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: PCA, pairs plots.\n\n\n\n\nLet’s check the loadings (i.e.: 21 Principal Components capture more than 80% of the variance in the) for the top 4 Principal Components. These indicate which genes are the more responsible to explain the position of the samples along the components, and the direction of this separation.\nLooking at the top 1% most variable proteins (~ 24 proteins), the following 7 proteins are the top loadings for the first 4 Principal Components:\n\nATM\nCLAUDIN7\nEPPK1\nGAPDH\nHSP70\nMYH11\nNDRG1_pT346\n\nLet’s now check the expression of the five top genes identified with the PCA across the cancer types:\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: PCA, loadings.\n\n\n\n\nCLAUDIN-7 is a known diagnostic immunohistochemical marker for classifing chromophobe renal carcinoma (KICH), and indeed seems overexpressed in KICH when compared to KIRC and KIRP.\nLet’s check the Pearson correlation with other clinical covariates.\nHistological grade, subtype mRNA and subtype miRNA strongly correlates with PC1. Cancer type, instead, correlates more with PC2. Interestingly, tumor stage, follow up tumor status and vital status correlates with PC5 (~4% of observed variance), which does not correlates with cancer type but does correlate with subtype protein. This suggest that there is a good correlation between the differences in protein abundances across the kidney carcinomas that correlate with a poorer prognosis, and this signal does not correlate with the kidney carcinoma type (cancer type), nor with the gene expression (subtype mRNA and subtype miRNA).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8: PCA, correlations between clinical covariates and Principal Components.",

    "text": "3.4 Differential protein abundance analysis\nIn addition to cancer type, we saw that age, ethnicity (and race) and age had somewhat a correlation with the cancer types.\nWe may want to include this covariates in the differential gene expression analysis in order to include their contribution into the model.\n\n3.4.1 Identification of differentially abundant proteins\nFor proteomics analyses, we use two arbitrary thresholds to retain genes that are significantly differentially expressed across the each comparison: an absolute logFold-Change (logFC) higher than 1, and an adjusted p-value lower than 0.05. This results in:\n\nKIRC_vs_KICH, 197 differentially abundant proteins, 105 upregulated and 92 downregulated\nKIRP_vs_KICH, 186 differentially abundant proteins, 97 upregulated and 89 downregulated\nKIRC_vs_KIRP, 207 differentially abundant proteins, 102 upregulated and 105 downregulated\n\nAs usual, we can visualize the logFC p-values relationships for all the proteins with a volcano plot.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9: Volcano plots of each contrats reporting the proteins differentially expressed.\n\n\n\n\nWe can also check the logFC and adjusted p-value for the top 7 proteins that are the top loadings for the first 4 Principal Components and see how these proteins were differentially abundant across the comparisons. We can confirm what we have naively observed at the level of protein abundance in Figure 7 while investigating the PCA loadings: CLAUDIN7 and NDRG1_pT346 are the top loadings for PC1, which separates KIRC from KICH and KIRP, and indeed, these proteins are the most differentially abundant in the comparisons of KIRC versus KIRP or KICH.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe UpSet plot shows that KIRC has a strong signature of 19 proteins that are differentially abundant when compared to KIRP or KICH. Moreover, KICH overexpresses c-KIT, ERα_pS118 and CDH1 and downregulates ATM, NDRG1_pT346 and PARP1 when compared to KIRC or KIRP.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10: UpSet reporting the proteins differentially expressed upregulated and downregulated in common across all contrasts.\n\n\n\n\nTables of differentially expressed proteins.\n\nKIRC vs KICHKIRP vs KICHKIRC vs KIRP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.4.2 Comparative enrichment analyses across cancer types\nIn the next steps we further characterize the differentially abundant proteins across the three kidney cancers by performing a Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA).\n\n3.4.2.1 GO Biological Process terms\nGene Ontology Biological Process are the larger processes or ‘biological programs’ accomplished by the concerted action of multiple molecular activities. Examples of broad BP terms are “DNA repair” or “signal transduction”. Examples of more specific terms are “cytosine biosynthetic process” or “D-glucose transmembrane transport”.\n\ndotplotterms mapgene map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11: dotplot of enriched GO Biological Process terms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12: Term maps reporting relationships between GO Biological Process across the different contrasts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13: gene maps reporting relationships between GO Biological Process enriched across the different contrasts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe enriched GO BP terms in KIRC vs. KIRP and KIRC vs. KICH suggest that KIRC has a strong enrichment in its catabolic metabolism, with enriched terms such as “carbohydrate catabolic process”, “glycogen catabolic process” and “glycogen metabolic process”. Enrichment of these terms are driven by the overabundance of Glycogen Phosphorylase B, L and M (PYGB, PYGL, PYGM), Lactate Dehydrogenase A (LDHA) and Glyceraldehyde-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (GAPDH) in KIRC when compared to KIRP and KICH.\nKICH seems instead to retain more its differentiation as highlighted by the lower abundance of Poly(ADP-Ribose) Polymerase 1 (PARP1) when compared to KIRC and KIRP, resulting in the enrichment of GO BP terms related to “Negative regulation of telomere maintainance”.\nThe complete list of 227 GO BP terms enriched across the three contrasts is reported below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.4.2.2 GO Cellular Compartments terms\nGene Ontology Cellular Compartment serves to capture the cellular location where a molecular function takes place.\n\ndotplotterms mapgene map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 14: dotplot of enriched GO Cellular Compartments terms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15: Term maps reporting relationships between GO Cellular Compartments across the different contrasts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 16: gene maps reporting relationships between GO Cellular Compartments enriched across the different contrasts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGO CC enrichment analyses do not provides any further insights on the characterization of kidney carcinomas based on their proteomics profiles.\nThe complete list of 23 GO CC terms enriched across the three contrasts is reported below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.4.2.3 GO Molecular Function terms\nGene Ontology Molecular Function serves to represent molecular-level activities performed by gene products.\n\ndotplotterms mapgene map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 17: dotplot of enriched GO Molecular Functions terms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 18: Term maps reporting relationships between GO Molecular Functions across the different contrasts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 19: gene maps reporting relationships between GO Molecular Functions enriched across the different contrasts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnrichment of GO MF terms confirm the catabolic signature of KIRC when compared to KIRP and KICH, with enriched terms such as “glycosiltransferase activity” and “pyridoxal phosphate binding” driven by the over abundance of PYGB, PYGL and PYGM.\nThe complete list of 35 GO MF terms enriched across the three contrasts is reported below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.4.2.4 KEGG pathways\nKEGG pathways are manually curated and capture our knowledge of the molecular interaction, reaction and relation networks.\n\ndotplotterms mapgene map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 20: dotplot of enriched KEGG pathways.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 21: Term maps reporting relationships between KEGG pathways enriched across the different contrasts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 22: gene maps reporting relationships between KEGG pathways enriched across the different contrasts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso the enriched KEGG pathways revolved around the metabolic disregulation of KIRC (e.g.: “Glycolysis / Gluconeogenesis” and “Starch and sucrose metabolism”) when compared to KIRP and KICH, linked as well to “Necroptosis” and “HIF-1 signaling pathway”.\nThe complete list of 30 KEGG pathways across the three contrasts is reported below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.4.2.5 Reactome pathways\nSimilarly to KEGG, Reactome pathways are manually curated biological pathways.\n\ndotplotgene map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 23: dotplot of enriched Reactome pathways.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 24: gene maps reporting relationships between Reactome pathways enriched across the different contrasts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgain, enriched Reactome pathways characterized KIRC “Glycogen metabolism”, “Metabolosim of charbohydrates” and “Pyruvate metabolism” when compared to KIRP and KICH kidney carcinomas.\nThe complete list of 10 Reactome pathways enriched across the three contrasts is reported below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.4.2.6 WikiPathways\nLastly, also WikiPathways provides another angle on a set of manually curated biological pathways.\n\ndotplotterms mapgene map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 25: dotplot of enriched Wikipathways pathways.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 26: Term maps reporting relationships between WikiPathways enriched across the different contrasts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 27: gene maps reporting relationships between WikiPathways enriched across the different contrasts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe enriched WikiPathways confirmed the “Aerobiuc glycolysis - augmented” in KIRC, when compared to KIRP and KIRCH, as well as a proper “Clear cell renal cell carcinoma pathwyas”, driven by the abundance of GAPDH, LDHA and LDHB.\nKICH retention of differentiation was supported by the abundance of the ATM Serine/Threonine Kinase ATM and PARP1, which resulted in the enrichment of terms such as “DNA IR-double strand breaks and cellular response via ATM”.\nThe complete list of 53 WikiPathways pathways enriched across the three contrasts is reported below.",

We first start with an overview of the datasets and QC.\nLet’s check the gene counts distributions across samples. We have counts information for 846 samples and a total of 743 micro-RNAs. There are no missing-values, so the count matrix has 100% occupancy. Looking at the counts distributions across the three kidney carcinomas, we observe an over-abundance of micro-RNAs with an average expression of 0 across the samples.\nTo best capture the biological signal, it would be beneficial to discard the micro-RNAs that have an expression of zero across all or most of the samples, so that we can focus on the ones that were expressed in the biopsies of the patients with kidney carcinomas.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: micro-RNAs expression distributions before filtering.\n\n\n\n\nFiltering of lowly expressed micro-RNAs resulted in the exclusion of 553 of the 743 micro-RNAs.\nIn Figure 2 we can see the expression profiles across the kidney carcinomas samples of the 190 remaining micro-RNAs. Now, the average (log2) expression across samples is around 5.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: micro-RNAs expression distributions after filtering.",

    "text": "4.3 Dimesionality Reduction and Dataset Exploration\n\n4.3.1 UMAP on filtered transcriptomics data\nLet’s check the samples clustering on a UMAP. The UMAP based on micro-RNAs data has a worse clustering of the samples to the different kidney carcinomas when compared to the UMAP based on the transcriptomics data (see Section 2.3.1) and the UMAP based on the proteomics data (see Section 3.3.1). Many KIRC samples in fact are interspersed between the KIRP cluster and the KIRC cluster, suggesting a more complex relationship between micro-RNAs expression and the different kidney carcinomas classification.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Kidney micro-RNAs UMAP.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.3.2 Principal Component Analysis (PCA)\nAs we did for the transcriptomics data (see Chapter 2) and the proteomics one (see Chapter 3), the next step in the dataset exploration is to perform the Principal Component Analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: PCA, exploration.\n\n\n\n\nThe first 19 Principal Components capture more than 80% of the variance in the Kidney cancers micro-RNAs datasets, with the first two components (PC1 and PC2) capturing almost 40% of the variance.\nWhen we project the samples in the PC1 and PC2, we can see that the PC1 has a gradient of samples that go from KIRC to KIRP to KICH, which overlaps with the tail of KIRP samples. The second component PC2, instead, separated KIRC and KIRP from KICH. The first two principal components seems to separate the thee types of kidney carcinomas.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: PCA, biplot PC1 x PC2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: PCA, pairs plots.\n\n\n\n\nLet’s check the loadings (i.e.: 19 Principal Components capture more than 80% of the variance in the) for the top 4 Principal Components. These indicate which micro-RNAs are the more responsible to explain the position of the samples along the components, and the direction of this separation.\nLooking at the top most variable genes, the following 8 micro-RNAs are the top loadings for the first 4 Principal Components:\n\nhsa-miR-10b-5p\nhsa-miR-126-3p\nhsa-miR-143-5p\nhsa-miR-144-5p\nhsa-miR-183-5p\nhsa-miR-200c-3p\nhsa-miR-204-5p\nhsa-miR-9-5p\n\nLet’s now check the expression of the five top genes identified with the PCA across the cancer types:\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: PCA, loadings.\n\n\n\n\nThe miR-200 family is suggested to represent a good prognostic marker in clear cell renal cell carcinoma. In our analysis, hsa-miR-200c-3p seems to be overexpressed in KICH when compared to KIRC and KIRP. Lower expression of hsa-miR-200c-3p are associated with worse prognosis and carcinomas, in line with the better prognosis for KICH patients observed in our previous analysis (see Section 1.3.7).\nLet’s check the Pearson correlation with other clinical covariates.\nCancer type correlates with PC2, that, as we saw in the biplot in Figure 5, clearly separates KIRC and KIRP from KICH. Subtype miRNA and most of the other molecular subtypes assigned by TCGA strongly correlated with PC1 and PC2. Subtype miRNA also correlates with PC5. We observed little to no correlation with vital status or residual disease (follow up tumor status).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8: PCA, correlations between clinical covariates and Principal Components.",

This results in:\n\nKIRC_vs_KICH, 157 differentially expressed micro-RNAs, 118 upregulated and 49 downregulated\nKIRP_vs_KICH, 155 differentially expressed micro-RNAs, 87 upregulated and 68 downregulated\nKIRC_vs_KIRP, 163 differentially expressed micro-RNAs, 105 upregulated and 55 downregulated\n\nAs usual, we can visualize the logFC p-values relationships for all the micro-RNAs with a volcano plot.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9: Volcano plots of each contrats reporting the micro-RNAs differentially expressed.\n\n\n\n\nWe can also check the logFC and adjusted p-value for the top 8 micro-RNAs that are the top loadings for the first 4 Principal Components and see how these micro-RNAs were differentially expressed across the comparisons.\nWe can confirm what we have naively observed at the level of micro-RNAs expression in Figure 7 while investigating the PCA loadings: hsa-miR-200c-3p and hsa-miR-204c-5p are the top loadings for PC2, which separates KIRC and KIRP from KICH, and indeed, these micro-RNAs are the most differentially expressed in the comparisons of KIRC and KIRP versus KICH, with hsa-miR-200c-3p strongly upregulated in KICH (&gt; 9 fold difference), while hsa-miR-204c-5p is strongly downregulates in KICH (&gt;5 fold difference).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe UpSet plot shows that KICH has a strong signature of 30 micro-RNAs that are differentially abundant when compared to KIRC or KIRP, including hsa-miR-34a-5p, hsa-miR-146a-5p, hsa-miR-146b-5p, hsa-miR-181a-3p, hsa-miR-204-5p and hsa-miR-200c-3p.

    "text": "5.2 Copy Number Variants (CNVs)\n\n5.2.1 Filtering & QC\nThe copy number variants are available at TCGA as information collapsed at the gene level. CNVs information are reported for 24,776 genes. For each gene, we have an integer value ranging from -2 (complete deletion of the genomic region) to +2 (complete duplication of both alleles), with 0 indicating no CNV event for that gene.\nAll of the 24,776 reported genes are affected by at least a CNV event across 877 kidney carcinomas samples, only for 10 samples we do not have CNV information.\nPatients affected by KICH kidney carcinomas seem to have a significantly higher number of genes affected by CNVs, followed by KIRP patients. KIRC patients have the least amount of genes affected by CNVs. In KICH and KIRP patients, also, CNVs involving gene duplications are more abundant than the ones involving gene deletions.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: CNVs distributions across kidney carcinomas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2.2 CNVs signatures across Kidney cancers\nLet’s now investigate the presence of any CNV signature across the three kidney carcinomas. As mentioned before, the provided TCGA CNVs data are reported at the gene level, but obviously, Whole Genome Duplication or Chromosomal Aberration events would usually be larger than a single gene and span several genes. Since we do not have access to the raw genomics data, a first naive approach would be to walk each chromosome and bridge together as single CNV event regions between consecutive genes having the same CNV score as reported by TCGA. This would allow to collapse the information of 24,776 different segments (the reported genes) into tens or hundreds of long, consecutive genomics ranges. The approach would work well under the assumption that large CNV events are much more likely to happen than short, isolated CNV events, i.e.: spanning just one or few genes. Moreover, the available CNV data are limited to the gene level (~1-2% of total human genome length), which implies that we have no direct information on CNV events (or lack thereof) over 98% of the genome. So, we have decided to do not bridge the genomic regions across consecutive genes with the same CNV score as single CNV events, and keep the downstream CNV analyses at the gene level.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: CNVs distributions at the gene level across 877 kidney carcinomas biopsies.\n\n\n\n\nAs seen in Figure 1, biopsies from KICH patients show extensive CNV events that seems to span most of the coding genome. CNVs events seems to have similar patterns across the different kidney carcinomas, and they appear to span full-length chromosomes. Within each kidney carcinoma type, it seems like biopsies could be clustered in different subtypes dependeing on their CNV signatures.\nIn the next steps, we will try to correlates these CNV signatures to other clinical covariates.\n\n\n5.2.3 Dimesionality Reduction and Dataset Exploration\n\n5.2.3.1 UMAP on CNVs data\nLet’s check how the samples cluster on a UMAP. For transcriptomics data (see Section 2.3.1) we have drawn the UMAP based on the top 1,000 most variable genes. Given the nature (and distribution) of the underlying CNV data, we have decided to draw the UMAP based on the top 1,000, 2,000, 3,000, 4,000, 5,000 and 10,000 most variable CNV-affected genes.\nIncreasing the number of genes to compute the UMAP improved the clustering between the samples of the different kidney carcinomas. A cluster of overlapping biopsies from the three kidney carcinomas is visible on the right hand side of N=1000, N=2000, N=3000, N=10000 and on the left-hand side of N=5000 suggesting that CNVs can poorly discriminate between KIRC, KIRP and KICH only on a subset of CNV subtypes.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Kidney CNVs UMAPs based on top N most variable CNV-affected genes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2.3.2 Principal Component Analysis (PCA)\nAs we did for the other omics data, the next step in the dataset exploration is to perform the Principal Component Analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: PCA, exploration.\n\n\n\n\nThe first 18 Principal Components capture more than 80% of the variance in the Kidney cancers CNVs dataset, with the first two components (PC1 and PC2) capturing a bit more than 33% of the variance.\nWhen we project the samples in the PC1 and PC2, we can see that the PC1 separates KIRC, KICH and KIRP, which instead cluster together. As observed in the UMAP, the clustering is more noisy than what observed for the other omics analyses (transcriptomics, proteomics and micro-RNAs).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: PCA, biplot PC1 x PC2.\n\n\n\n\nWe can also investigate other dimensions Principal Components, to see if there is a component that manages to fully resove the three cancer types. PC1 PC4 seems to best separate samples from KIRC, KIRP and KICH.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: PCA, pairs plots.\n\n\n\n\nLet’s check the Pearson correlation with other clinical covariates.\nCancer_type correlates well with PC1 and PC4. Most of the TCGA-defined molecular subtypes correlates with PC1, PC2 and PC4. Interestingly, TCGA Subtype_CNA, which should be based on he CNV data, correlates with PC3 and PC4, but not PC1. PC3 is interesting since it correlates with follow_up_tumor_status, pathologic_t and tumor_stage, suggesting a link between CNVs signatures and cancer advancement, which is a common feature across all kidney carcinomas and not limited to KIRC, KIRP or KICH.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: PCA, correlations between clinical covariates and Principal Components.",

    "text": "5.3 Somatic mutations\nLet’s now dig into the Somatic Mutations detected in the biopsies of the kidney carcinomas patients. We have somatic information for 711 samples (~80% of the total 887 patients in the cohort). TCGA provides information on somatic mutations as binary information for each gene: 1, if the patient has a non-silent mutation for that gene, or 0, if the patient does not have a non-silent mutation on that gene. We could retrieve info for for 40,542 genes, and 13,584 of them had a non-silent mutations in at least one of our 711 kidney carcinomas patients. The first step was then to discard from downstream analysis the 26,958 that appeared not mutated in the kidney carcinomas biopsies.\nLet’s now look at the distribution of somatic mutations across the different kidney carcinomas. KICH patients had an average of 31 genes with non-mutations, against the 53 and 56 average number of genes with non-silent mutations in KIRC and KIRP patients, respectively. Chromosomes 1, 2, 3, 11, 17 nad 19 where the chromosomes with more mutated genes on average.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8: Non-silent somatic mutations distributions.\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3.1 Mutational signatures across Kidney cancers\nLet’s now investigate the presence of any non-silent somatic mutation signature across the three kidney carcinomas.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9: non-silent somatic mutations distributions across 711 kidney carcinomas biopsies.\n\n\n\n\nWhile for KICH and KIRP patients the non-silent somatic mutations seems to be evenly distributed across the genome, KIRC patients clearly show an over-abundance of 3 preferably mutated genes, one in chromosome 2 and two in chromosome 3.\n\n\nUsing external_gene_name as id variables\n\n\nIn KICH, ~30% of the patients (21 / 66) had a non-silent mutation in TP53, followed by 9% of patients (6 / 66) having a mutation on PTEN. As expected, KIRC patients show the highest mutational burden, with ~47% of patients (170 / 365) with mutation in VHL, ~40% of patients (145 / 365) with mutation on PBRM1 and ~20% of patients (72 / 365) with non-silent somatic mutations on TTN. As well, 16% of KIRP patients (45 / 280) has non-silent somatic mutations on TTN gene.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10: top 10 genes with non-silent somatic mutations across the kidney carcinomas.\n\n\n\n\nIn the table below are reported all the 19,573 somatic mutations detected across the biopsies of the three kidney carcinomas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3.2 Dimesionality Reduction and Dataset Exploration\n\n5.3.2.1 UMAP on somatic mutations data\nLet’s check how the samples cluster on a UMAP. As for the CNVs data (see Section 5.2.3.1), given the nature (and distribution) of the underlying non-silent mutations data, we have decided to draw the UMAP based on the top 1,000, 2,000, 3,000, 4,000, 5,000 and 10,000 most variable affected genes.\nThe non-silent somatic mutation data did not resulted in any interpretable cluster.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11: UMAP based on non-silent somatic mutation data of kidney carcinomas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3.2.2 Principal Component Analysis (PCA)\nAs we did for the other omics data, the next step in the dataset exploration is to perform the Principal Component Analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12: PCA, exploration.\n\n\n\n\nThe PCA captures little to no variance observed in the non-silent somatic mutations, moreover, it fails to cluster the biopsies based on the kidney carcinoma type of origin, as seen with the UMAP. Few samples seems to be outliers driving most of the variance observed in PC1 (1.82% variance) and PC2 (1.37% variance).\nPC4 and PC6 seems to separate KIRC samples into four distinct clusters, one of which overlapping with a cluster containing as well KIRP and KICH biopsies.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13: PCA, pairs plots.\n\n\n\n\nPC4 (0.66% of observed variance) seems to correlate with some clinical covariates, such as histological_grade and subtype_mRNA, but it is difficult to attach a biological relevance to this observation since we cannot properly cluster samples on the PCAs.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 14: PCA, correlations between clinical covariates and Principal Components.",

    "text": "5.4 Epigenomics\nNow, we move forward to analyse the epigenomics data, that provides information on the methylation status of the CpG islands across the genomes of the kidney carcinomas. The methylation status is captured with Illumina 450k arrays, and for each CpG island we have two measurements: a methylated intensity (M) and an unmethylated intensity (U) that allows for calculating the propostion of methilation at each CpG island.\nFor the TCGA epigenomics data, for each CpG island we have available the corresponding Beta value, which is calculated as:\nbeta = M / (M / U)\nUnder ideal conditions, a value of zero indicates that all copies of the CpG site in the sample were completely unmethylated (no methylated molecules were measured) and a value of one indicates that every copy of the site was methylated.\n\n5.4.1 Filtering & QC\nWe have methylation information for 646 out of the 887 kidney carcinoma biopsies: 65 KICH, 311 KIRC and 270 KIRP patients, respectively. TCGA provides methylation status as beta values for 148,068 whitelisted probes. Out of them, 6,364 probes consistently have missing values across the 646 samples, so after filtering them out we obtain 141,704 probes.\nPlotting the beta-values distribution for the probes of each biopsies reveals their bimodal distribution, indicating that for each sample, the probes can either be unmethylated (beta value = 0) or methylated (beta value = 1).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15: Distribution of whitelisted beta values densities across the 646 kidney carcinoma biopsies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4.2 Dimesionality Reduction and Dataset Exploration\n\n5.4.2.1 UMAP on epigenomics data\nLet’s check the samples clustering on a UMAP based on epigenomics data. Methylation data manages to clusters KIRC, KICH and KIRP biopsies according to their kidney carcinoma type. While KIRC and KIRP clusters are well defined, the KICH cluster seems to include as well samples from KIRC and KIRP, suggesting that the top 1,000 most variable probes fail to fully resolve the cancer types, or that different subtypes with similar methylation patterns exists across KIRC, KIRP and KICH.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 16: Kidney epigenomics UMAP.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4.2.2 Principal Component Analysis (PCA)\nThe next step in the dataset exploration is to perform the Principal Component Analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 17: PCA, exploration.\n\n\n\n\nThe first 10 Principal Components capture less than 50% of the variance in the Kidney cancers epigenomics dataset, with the first two components (PC1 and PC2) capturing a bit more than 20% of the variance. The screeplot, however, shows a more reasonable amount of variance capture in the top Principal Components, in contrasts to what seen using non-silent somatic mutations (see Section 5.3.2.2).\nWhen we project the samples in the PC1 and PC2, we can see that the PC1 (~13% of observed variance) creates a gradient of samples that separates KICH, KIRC and KIRP. The second component PC2 (~10% of variance), instead, does not separates the samples based on their kidney carcinoma types.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 18: PCA, biplot PC1 x PC2.\n\n\n\n\nWe can also investigate other dimensions Principal Components, to see if there is a component that manages to fully resolve the three cancer types. PC1xPC4 and PC1xPC5 indeed seem to separates better the three kidney carcinoma types.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 19: PCA, pairs plots.\n\n\n\n\nLet’s check the loadings for the top 5 Principal Components. These indicate which probes are the more responsible to explain the position of the samples along the components, and the direction of this separation.\nLooking at the top 1% most variable probes, the following 11 probes are the top loadings for the first 5 Principal Components:\n\ncg03830585\ncg07037412\ncg07159758\ncg08135406\ncg05098566\ncg07635227\ncg00868875\ncg07124687\ncg01916088\ncg03893663\ncg00204802\ncg01233786\ncg00806644\n\nLet’s now check their beta values distributions of the five top genes identified with the PCA across the cancer types:\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 20: PCA, loadings.\n\n\n\n\ncg03830585 is associated with the Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate Receptor, Type 1 ITPR1. ITPR1 is a novel target of novel target of HIF2α and protects renal cancer cells against natural killer cells by inducing autophagy. cg03830585 appears hypermethylated in KIRP, but not in KICH (cold tumor) and KIRC (hot tumor, with immuno-suppressant and immuni-evasive profile). cg00868875 is linked to the Potassium Channel Tetramerization Domain Containing 1 KCTD1, which is a prognostic marker for KIRP. Finally, cg07037412 is linked to the Calcium Voltage-Gated Channel Subunit Alpha1 H CACNA1H. Lower methylation status in KIRC and KIRP is congruent with the observation that CACNA1H was specifically overexpressed relative to normal tissue samples in renal cancer, sarcoma and gastrointestinal stromal tumors.\nLet’s now check the Pearson correlation with other clinical covariates.\nCancer type strongly correlates with PC1 (~13% of observed variance) and PC5 (~3% of observed variance), which is concordant with what we have observed in the PCA pairplots: the three kidney carcinoma types are well separated in these components. PC1 also correlates well with hystological grade, selected subtype, subtype miRNA and subtype mRNA. PC2 (~10% of observed variance) and PC3 (~6% of observed variance) strongly correlates with subtype integrative, but more interestingly with subtype DNAmeth, histological grade, tumor stage, follow up tumor status and vital status. Indeed, the PCA pairplots shows that PC2 and PC3 cluster and separate very well biopsies from KICH, KIRC and KIRP patients, despite these two components not correlating with cancer type. More interestingly, subtype DNAmeth co-correlates with residual disease, more advanced cancer and worse prognosis, suggesting that DNA methylations and epigenomics plays a major role in cancer evolution and disease outcome.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 21: PCA, correlations between clinical covariates and Principal Components.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4.3 Differential Methylation Analysis\nLet’s move forward now to the differential Methylation analysis. We will take two complementary approaches:\n\nProbe-Wise Differential Methylation\nRegion-Wise Differential Methylation (DMR)\n\nThe Probe-Wise Differential Methylation has a higher granularity (down to the single probe) allowing for a more precise characterization of the methylation status across the kidney carcinomas, but with the shortcoming of a more complex interpretation of the results. Gene / Region-Wise Differential Methylation approach, on the other hand, summarize the methylation status at the gene or at the region level, making comparisons and interpretation easier, with the downside of losing the signal of the methylation status of each CpG island.\n\n5.4.3.1 Probe-Wise Differential Methylation\nFor epigenomics, we use two arbitrary thresholds to retain genes that are significantly differentially methylated across the each comparison: an absolute logFold-Change (logFC) higher than 2, and an adjusted p-value lower than 0.05. This results in:\n\nKIRC_vs_KICH, 5,672 differentially methylated probes, 3,867 hypermethylated and 1,805 hypomethylated\nKIRP_vs_KICH, 8,024 differentially methylated probes, 6,403 hypermethylated and 1,621 hypomethylated\nKIRC_vs_KIRP, 954 differentially methylated probes, 163 hypermethylated and 791 hypomethylated\n\nAs usual, we can visualize the logFC p-values relationships for all the probes with a volcano plot.\nKICH appears to have the highest amount of hypomethylated probes, suggesting that many of their genes are expressed due to the hypomethylation of the corresponding CpG islands. On the other hand, KIRP seems to have the highest amount of hypermethylated probes of the three kidney carcinoma types, followed by KIRC.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 22: Volcano plots of each contrats reporting the differentially methylated probes.\n\n\n\n\nThe UpSet plot shows that KICH has a strong signature of 3,193 hypomethylated probes that are instead hypermethylated in KIRC and KIRP, and 999 hypermethylated probes that are insted hypomethylated in KIRC and KIRP. This methylation pattern can be ascribed to the fact that KICH carcinomas in general maintain their epithelial differentiation status, which instead is more often lost in KIRC and KIRP carcinomas. KIRP appears as the kidney carcinomas with most hypermethylated probes when compared to KIRC and KICH.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 23: UpSet reporting the genes differentially methylated probes in common across all contrasts.\n\n\n\n\nTables of differentially methylated probes.\n\nKIRC vs KICHKIRP vs KICHKIRC vs KIRP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s see if any function is enriched in the genes of linked to the Differentially Methylated Probes by performing Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA). The first step is to identify the list of linked to the differentially methylated probes. Then, we will run standard GSEA on these list of differentially methylated genes.\n\n5.4.3.1.1 GO Biological Process terms\nGene Ontology Biological Process are the larger processes or ‘biological programs’ accomplished by the concerted action of multiple molecular activities. Examples of broad BP terms are “DNA repair” or “signal transduction”. Examples of more specific terms are “cytosine biosynthetic process” or “D-glucose transmembrane transport”.\n\ndotplotterms mapgene mapGO terms clusters\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 24: dotplot of enriched GO Biological Process terms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 25: Term maps reporting relationships between GO Biological Process across the different contrasts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 26: gene maps reporting relationships between GO Biological Process enriched across the different contrasts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 27: GO cluster heatmaps.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe enriched GO BP terms in KIRC vs. KICH and KIRP vs. KICH suggest indeed a disregulated methylation on “embryonic organ morphogenesis”, “kidney epithelium development”, and “regulation of cell-cell adhesion”, supporting the idea that KICH biopsies mostly retained their epithelial differentiation that was instead lost in KIRC and in KIRP. These changes are also highlighted by the disregulation of “small GTPase mediated signal transduction” and the “Wnt signaling pathway”.\nIn addition to that, genes involved in the “regulation of macrophages chemotaxis” are differentially methylated in KIRC vs. KIRP, correlating nicely with the evidences of a high abundance of infiltrating Macrophages M0 and M2 in KIRP generated by deconvoluting the infiltrating immune cells based on bulk transcriptomics data (see Chapter 2).\nThe complete list of 1,881 GO BP terms enriched across the three contrasts is reported below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4.3.1.2 GO Cellular Compartments terms\nGene Ontology Cellular Compartment serves to capture the cellular location where a molecular function takes place.\n\ndotplotterms mapgene map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 28: dotplot of enriched GO Cellular Compartments terms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 29: Term maps reporting relationships between GO Cellular Compartments across the different contrasts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 30: gene maps reporting relationships between GO Cellular Compartments enriched across the different contrasts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGO CC enrichment analyses do not provides any further insights on the characterization of kidney carcinomas based on their methytlation profiles, except for a high disregulation of genes associated with “adherens junctions”, “focal adhesion” and “membrane raft”, ad well as potential transporters in the “apical plasma membrane” and “basal plasma membrane”.\nThe complete list of 245 GO CC terms enriched across the three contrasts is reported below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4.3.1.3 GO Molecular Function terms\nGene Ontology Molecular Function serves to represent molecular-level activities performed by gene products.\n\ndotplotterms mapgene map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 31: dotplot of enriched GO Molecular Functions terms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 32: Term maps reporting relationships between GO Molecular Functions across the different contrasts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 33: gene maps reporting relationships between GO Molecular Functions enriched across the different contrasts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnrichment of GO MF terms confirm the methylation driven disregulation of multiple signaling pathways in KIRC and KIRP when compared to KICH, including “GTPase regulator activity” and “protein serine/threonine kinases activity”.\nThe complete list of 149 GO MF terms enriched across the three contrasts is reported below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4.3.1.4 KEGG pathways\nKEGG pathways are manually curated and capture our knowledge of the molecular interaction, reaction and relation networks.\n\ndotplotterms mapgene map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 34: dotplot of enriched KEGG pathways.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 35: Term maps reporting relationships between KEGG pathways enriched across the different contrasts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 36: gene maps reporting relationships between KEGG pathways enriched across the different contrasts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe enriched KEGG pathways revolved around the remodeling of the extracellular matrix (“Adherens junctions”, “Focal adhesion”) and a pro-inflammatory, hypoxic microenvironment in KIRC (“HIF-1 signaling pathway” and “Inflammatory mediator regulation of TRP channels”). Interestingly, KIRC also showed disregulation of the “Fructose and mannose metabolism” via differential methylation of GMDS, KHK, PFKFB2 and PFKFB4. PFKFB4 has been shown a non-canonical activity where it interacts with ICMT and activates RAS/AKT signaling-dependent cell migration in melanoma.\nThe complete list of 166 KEGG pathways across the three contrasts is reported below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4.3.1.5 Reactome pathways\nSimilarly to KEGG, Reactome pathways are manually curated biological pathways.\n\ndotplotterms mapgene map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 37: dotplot of enriched Reactome pathways.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 38: Term maps reporting relationships between Reactome pathways enriched across the different contrasts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 39: gene maps reporting relationships between Reactome pathways enriched across the different contrasts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe enriched Reactome pathways provide us with an additional layer of information. KIRC and KIRP differentiate from KIRC due to differential methylation of phosphoinositol3-kinase associated secondary signal transduction pathways (“PI3K/AKT Signaling in Cancer”, “DAG and IP3 signaling”, “PLC beta mediated events”, “CaM pathway”, “CREB1 phosphorylation through NMDA receptor-mediated activation of RAS signaling”, “VEGFA-VEGFR2 Pathway”). In addition to that, we have as well “NRAGE signals death through JNK” and “RHO GTPase cycle” and “RAC1 GTPase cycle”. Integrin-based extracellular matrix remodelling is linked to KIRP via differentially methylation of the transcription factor RUNX2 and the cyclin CCND1, which is known to be overexpressed in KIRP.\nThe complete list of 160 Reactome pathways enriched across the three contrasts is reported below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4.3.1.6 WikiPathways\nLastly, also WikiPathways provides another angle on a set of manually curated biological pathways.\n\ndotplotgene map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 40: dotplot of enriched Wikipathways pathways.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 41: gene maps reporting relationships between WikiPathways enriched across the different contrasts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, the enriched WikiPathways confirmed the retention of eputhelial identity in KICH versus the pluripotency of KIRC and KIRP and their higher chance of epithelial-to-mesenchimal transition (“Ectoderm differentiation”, “Mesodermal commitment pathway”). Moreover, genes associated with “Macrophage-stimulating protein (MSP) signaling” were differentially methylated in KIRP when compared to KIRC and KICH.\nThe complete list of 122 WikiPathways pathways enriched across the three contrasts is reported below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4.3.2 Region-wise Differential Methylation (DMR)\nWhile the probe-wise analysis has the highest resolution in terms of detection of methylation at the single CpG island level, it suffers from several limitations. Methylation of a single CpG island could be hard to detect, and it is not very informative since gene promoters are regulated by the methylation status of multiple CpG islands simultaneously. Moreover, for the enrichment analysis, even if a single CpG island linked to a gene would be differentially methylated, that gene would appear in the GSEA, bloating the number of false positives and enriched pathways identified.\nA common way to mitigate the single-probe analyses drawback is to look if the methylation status of several CpGs near to each other (or regions) are concordantly differentially methylated or not. To identify Differentially Methylated Regions, we gather the single-probes into predefined and manually annotated functional regions using the BioConductor package mCSEA, which contains three types of regions for 450K and EPIC arrays: promoter regions, gene body and CpG Islands. mCSEA algorithm is based on standard GSEA. Briefly, CpG sites are ranked according to a metric (logFC, t-statistic, …) and an enrichment score (ES) is calculated for each region. This is done by running through the entire ranked CpG list, increasing the score when a CpG in the region is encountered and decreasing the score when the gene encountered is not in the region. A high ES indicates these probes are found high up in the ranked list. In other words, a high (N)ES value means that for the CpG sites in this region there is - on average - a shift towards a higher methylation level. This approach has been shown to be more effective to detect smaller but consistent methylation differences.\n\nKIRC vs KICHKIRP vs KICHKIRC vs KIRP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKIRC vs KICH genes 142 promoters 86\nKIRP vs KICH genes 0 promoters 71\nKIRC vs KIRP genes 52 promoters 145\ncc\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 42: UpSet reporting the genes Differentially Methylated Regions in common across all contrasts.\n\n\n\n\nLet’s see if any function is enriched in the genes of the Differentially Methilated Probes.

    "text": "7.2 Survival Analysis: Overall Survival\nIntro\nLoad data\nwe have these timepoints:\n\noverall survival (OS)\ndisease-specific survival (DSS)\ndisease-free interval (DFI)\nprogression-free interval (PFI)\n\nto that, we add info:\n\nvital status\ndays to death\ncancer type\n\nwe will measure a Kaplan Meier curve and fit a Cox Proportional Hazards Model for each kidney cancer subtype only based on the observations and classification available in the metadata. Then, we will add the weights for Factors 1, 2 and 3 that we have calculated with the Factor Analysis (Chapter 6) on the integrated multi-omics datasets (transcriptomics, miRNAs, proteomics and epigenomics). We compare the results and we see if adding info from the multi-omics lead to a model that predicts better the clinical outcome.\n\n7.2.1 Metadata only\nlet’s do it with metadat aonly first\n\n7.2.1.1 Kaplan Meier\nplot the survival\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: survival\n\n\n\n\ncompare survival plots\nlog rank test\nCall: survival::survdiff(formula = survival::Surv(OS.time, vital_status) ~ cancer_type, data = metadata)\nn=885, 2 observations deleted due to missingness.\n                    N Observed Expected (O-E)^2/E (O-E)^2/V\ncancer_type=TCGA-KICH 65 9 26.0 11.14 12.87 cancer_type=TCGA-KIRC 531 174 140.4 8.04 21.18 cancer_type=TCGA-KIRP 289 44 60.6 4.54 6.26\nChisq= 23.9 on 2 degrees of freedom, p= 6e-06\nAs noted on this page the term (O-E)^2/V is the basis for the log-rank test.\nTo know if the difference between the observed and expected events (O-E) for one group is significantly different from 0 (that is, the two groups have significantly different hazard functions), you need an estimate of the variance of that difference in the case (null hypothesis) that the groups have the same hazard function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.2.1.2 Cox regression model\nCox proportional hazards regression is one of the most popular regression techniques for survival analysis. Other models can also be used since the Cox model requires important assumptions that need to be verified for an appropriate use such as the proportional hazards assumption: see references.\nIn a Cox proportional hazards regression model, the measure of effect is the hazard rate (HR), which is the risk of failure (or the risk of death in our example), given that the participant has survived up to a specific time. Usually, we are interested in comparing independent groups with respect to their hazards, and we use a hazard ratio, which is analogous to an odds ratio in the setting of multiple logistic regression analysis. The cox.ph() function from the survival package is used to fit the model. The function cox.zph() from survival package may be used to test the proportional hazards assumption for a Cox regression model fit.\nNOTE: A probability must lie in the range 0 to 1. However, the hazard represents the expected number of events per one unit of time.\n\nIf the hazard ratio for a predictor is close to 1 then that predictor does not affect survival,\nif the HR is less than 1, then the predictor is protective (i.e., associated with improved survival),\nand if the HR is greater than 1, then the predictor is associated with increased risk (or decreased survival).\n\n[[[now we can add more covariates, but we have to check if the proportional hazard assumption holds true]]]\nIn another model we add more risk factors such as the source of infection and the number of days between date of onset and admission.

Other models can also be used since the Cox model requires important assumptions that need to be verified for an appropriate use such as the proportional hazards assumption: see references.\nIn a Cox proportional hazards regression model, the measure of effect is the hazard rate (HR), which is the risk of failure (or the risk of death in our example), given that the participant has survived up to a specific time. Usually, we are interested in comparing independent groups with respect to their hazards, and we use a hazard ratio, which is analogous to an odds ratio in the setting of multiple logistic regression analysis. The cox.ph() function from the survival package is used to fit the model. The function cox.zph() from survival package may be used to test the proportional hazards assumption for a Cox regression model fit.\nNOTE: A probability must lie in the range 0 to 1. However, the hazard represents the expected number of events per one unit of time.\n\nIf the hazard ratio for a predictor is close to 1 then that predictor does not affect survival,\nif the HR is less than 1, then the predictor is protective (i.e., associated with improved survival),\nand if the HR is greater than 1, then the predictor is associated with increased risk (or decreased survival).\n\n[[[now we can add more covariates, but we have to check if the proportional hazard assumption holds true]]]\nIn another model we add more risk factors such as the source of infection and the number of days between date of onset and admission. This time, we first verify the proportional hazards assumption before going forward.\nIn this model, we have included a continuous predictor (days_onset_hosp). In this case we interpret the parameter estimates as the increase in the expected log of the relative hazard for each one unit increase in the predictor, holding other predictors constant.
