    "text": "Abstract\n[[draft to improve]]\nThe complex and heterogeneous nature of cancer necessitates innovative approaches for effective target discovery and therapeutic development. Multiomics integration—combining genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolomic, and epigenomic data—has emerged as a transformative strategy in cancer research, significantly accelerating the identification of novel therapeutic targets. By leveraging the wealth of biological information from multiple layers of molecular data, researchers can gain comprehensive insights into tumor biology, elucidate underlying mechanisms of disease progression, and uncover potential vulnerabilities in cancer cells.\nHere, I leverage public datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas program, TCGA. I will focus my efforts on Kidney Cancers: kidney chromophobe (KICH), kidney renal papillary cell carcinoma (KIRP), and kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC).\nFirst, we gonna explore how molecular differences between these three kidney cancers are captured and reflected in different single-omics layers (i.e.: transcriptomics, proteomics), and how linear multi-omics integration strategies deepen the biological insights.\nI will then dig into kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC) and develop a Deep Learning classifier to discriminate between the different KIRC consensus molecular subtypes. I will compare my method with existing molecular signatures based on transcriptomics data, and test if the new classifier can better classify samples from another cohort and best predict the clinical outcome of the patients.\nFinally, I will try to identify novel therapeutic targets based on my molecular subtypes.",

While Xena provides some information, it lacks a cleaned table containing all the demographic information of the subjects. Conveniently, GitHub user ipezoa already retrieved from GDC and CGC and combined together all the metadata obtained from JSON and XML files. A thorough explanation of each metadata field is reported here.\nLet’s integrate all the metadata together. We have indeed access to a rich and comprehensive ensemble of clinical and sample metadata for the samples at hand.\n\nCohort demographics\nLet’s check the overall demographic distributions of all the samples.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Demographic overview\n\n\n\n\nWe notice that the ration between males and females included in the PanCan dataset is almost 1:1. As well, the age distributions for both sexes are very similar, and the averages of the two distributions almost overlap around 60 years old (59.4 years for female and 60.3 years for males). Race-wise, we have an over-representation of whites (73,4% of samples), followed by 12.0% of samples for which no race information is available. Blacks or african americans and asian represent a small percentage of the samples available, with 8.3% and 6.0% of the samples respectively.\n\n\nClinical overview\nLet’s check now the different cancer included in the study.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Clinical overview\n\n\n\n\nWe can check for any biases in terms of sex and ethnicity in the collected cancer samples.

    "text": "1.2 Selection of Kidney samples\nFor the next sections, we will focus on kidney cancer. The choice is simply dictated by the abundance of samples which provide us a large playground to test different strategies for biomarker discovery, higher statistical power, and the existance of some Molecular Subtypes gene signatures that we can use as a benchmark and we can try to improve upon.\nLet’s select and explore the samples available for Kidney tissue.\n\n1.2.1 General Overview of the Dataset\nTo have a first overview of all the Kidney samples, we will plot a UMAP based on the gene expression of all the biopsys. A UMAP is an algorithm for dimension reduction based on manifold learning techniques and ideas from topological data analysis. The UMAP algorithm first constructs a weighted graph of the data in input (with N-dimensions), where the weight in the graph edge corresponds to how similar is a point (i.e.: sample) to the next one, and then projects this similarity graph into a bi-dimensional space. The 2-D projection is optimized to faithfully represents the relationships between the points in the N-dimensional space.\nTo build the UMAP, we focus on the 1,000 top most variable genes between the transcriptomics samples. This allows us to maximize similarities and differences between sample groups (if any).\nThe UMAP of all the samples divides the biopsys into 4 major clusters. Three clusters are localized on the upper part of the UMAP, and they loosely correspond to the three cancer subtypes in this cohort: kidney chromophobe (KICH), kidney renal papillary cell carcinoma (KIRP), and kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC). A further separation of the samples is visible on the y axis: biopsys from primary tumor are localized on top of the UMAP, while a second cluster of normal solid tissue are localized in the bottom of the UMAP, containing samples from non-diseased tissues of patients of all of the three cancer types.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Kidney UMAP - unfiltered data\n\n\n\n\nSince we want to focus on discovering new biomarkers for the three kidney cancer types, we will remove the biopsys from normal solid tissue. Then, we test if there is a strong imbalance between the sex and age of the subjects in the three kidney cancer cohorts, and wheter we should balance the cohorts or not.\n\n\n1.2.2 Cohort filtering\nFirst, we retain only biopsys from “Primary Tumor”, removing “Solid Tissue Normal” and “Additional - New Primary” neoplasis. Then we look at the distribution of age, sex and ethnicity in the three different cancer cohorts.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Kidney Cancer: demographic overview\n\n\n\n\nWe can immediatly see that the sampling biase towards patients with white background observed in all the cancer cohorts in Section 3.1 is reflected as well in kidney cancer cohorts. In terms of geneder demographics, males represents from 60% (KICH) to 74% (KIRP) of the cohorts. The histograms split by cancer types, however, show that the age distributions between the sexs int he different kidney cancer types are similar.\nSince we may loose too many samples if we would generate balanced cohorts in terms of sex and race, we can keep the samples as is, and take Age, Sex and Race in account during the modeling phases downstream.",

    "text": "1.3 Contingency tables\nAs we saw previously TCGA provides rich clinical metadata for each patient. We can run some simple demographic statistics (chi-squared and Fisher exact tests) to see if any clinical covariate is significantly overrepresented in any of the three cancer types.\nWe can test if there is a significant difference of each observed clinical covariate across the three kidney cancer types. The null hypothesis here is that the distribution of each covariate in the the three cancer subtypes is the same.\n\n1.3.1 Sex\nThere are 596 males and 291 females in the three kidney cancer cohorts after filtering. Despite the imbalance, the difference across cancer types is not significant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Contigency table, Sex\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.3.2 Disease status\nAfter filtering, the three kidney cancer types contains 563 subject that are now tumor free, and 190 subject that still have tumor. It seems that KIRP have significantly more patients that are now tumor free, while there are still significantly more patients with tumor for KIRC. The small sample size of KICH patients may skew these results, so this outcome should be interpreted with a pinch of salt.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Contigency table, Disease Status\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.3.3 Tumor Stages\nThe tumors across the patients were scored as: 458 Stage I, 105 Stage II, 189 Stage III and 105 Stage IV tumors.\nThis staging system is less granular than the TNM Staging System (that we look at into below), and it describe the tumro as follow:\n\nStage 0 = Abnormal cells are present but have not spread to nearby tissue. Also called carcinoma in situ, or CIS. CIS is not cancer, but it may become cancer.\nStage I, Stage II, and Stage III = Cancer is present. The higher the number, the larger the cancer tumor and the more it has spread into nearby tissues.\nStage IV = The cancer has spread to distant parts of the body.\n\nThe higher the number, the more advanced the cancer is.\nKIRC patients seem to have a higher number of Stage IV cancer, while KIRP patients have more STage I cancers. This can either be bias in the sampling of the cohort, or it could really indicate that KIRC cancer is more aggressive and fast progressing than KIRP.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Contigency table, Tumor Stage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.3.4 Tumor Histology\nHistological evaluation of the tumor cells essential to allow for accurate prognostication and tailored therapy, both surgical and adjuvant.\nHistological grade have five categories:\n\nG1 = Well differentiated\nG2 = Moderately differentiated\nG3 = Poorly differentiated, Undifferentiated, Anaplastic\nG4 = Undifferentiated (high grade)\nGX = Grade cannot be assessed\n\nUnfortunately, within the TCGA kidney cohorts, only KIRC biopsys where graded histologically. No histological grading was available for KICH and KIRP tumors.\nFor the KIRC tumors, 14 biopsys had G1 grade, 229 G2 grade, 204 had G3 grade, 76 G4 and 5 biopsys could not be graded (GX).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Contigency table, Tumor Histology\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.3.5 TMN, T: Main Tumor Pathology\nLet’s look now into the TMN staging system. We have multiple staging and substaging that describes the tumor presence, dimension and invasion of adjacent tissues:\n\nTX = Primary tumor cannot be assessed.\nT0 = No evidence of primary tumor.\nT1 = Tumor ≤2 cm in greatest dimension.\nT2 = Tumor &gt;2 cm but ≤4 cm.\nT3 = Tumor &gt;4 cm or with subserosal invasion or involvement of the mesoappendix.\nT4 = Tumor perforates the peritoneum or directly invades other adjacent organs or structures (excluding direct mural extension to adjacent subserosa of adjacent bowel), e.g., abdominal wall and skeletal muscle.\n\nThe presence of 12 distinct substaging for TMN, and the relative small sample size across the cohort makes the outcome of this comparison difficult to judge. We could claim that KIRP seems to be enriched in lower tumor stages (T1a) and depleted in higher tumor stages (T2, T3a, T3b) than KIRC.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Contigency table, TMN Main Tumor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.3.6 TMN, N: Lymph Nodes metastatis\nThe TMN tumor staging system provides as well a score for the lymph nodes:\n\nNX = Regional lymph nodes cannot be assessed.\nN0 = No regional lymph node metastasis.\nN1 = Regional lymph node metastasis &lt;12 nodes.\nN2 = Large mesenteric masses (&gt;2 cm) and/or extensive nodal deposits (≥12), especially those that encase the superior mesenteric vessels.\n\nIn the kidney cohort, lymph nodes of 506 patiens could not be scored (NX), 328 patients had a N0 score, 43 N1 and 7 had a N2 score. Lymph nodes of most patients with KIRP tumors could not be scored, they they were depleted in No and enriched in N1 if compared with patients with KIRC tumor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8: Contigency table, TMN Lymph nodes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.3.7 Prognosis Outcome\nOf the 887 petients with kidney tumor, 659 were alive at the time of the last check up, while 228 died. It appears that KIRC patients (48.7% dead) have worse prognosis than KIRP patients (17.9% dead), as observed in the previous comparisons. However, before drawing a formal conclusion, we should validate this observation at least in another independent cohort.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9: Contigency table, Vital Status",

In a transcriptomics dataset, the number of Principal Components equals the number of samples.\nThe PCA algorithm is run in an iterative manner: the first Principal Component is calculated by finding the line that maximizes the variance between the samples. The second Principal Component is calculated in the same way, with the condition that it is uncorrelated with (i.e., perpendicular to) the first principal component and that it accounts for the next highest variance. The third Principal Component is calculated in the same way, down to the last Principal Component.\nTo run PCA analyses on transcriptomics data, I recommend the PCAtools package by Kevin Blighe and Aaron Lun.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: PCA, exploration\n\n\n\n\nThe first 24 Principal Components capture more than 80% of the variance in the Kidney cancers transcriptomics dataset, with the first two components (PC1 and PC2) capturing a bit more than 25% of the variance.\nWhen we project the samples in the PC1 and PC2, we can see that the PC1 separates KIRC from KICH adn KIRP, which instead cluster together. The second component PC2, instead, seems to partially separate KICH and KIRP samples.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: PCA, biplot PC1 x PC2\n\n\n\n\nWe can also investigate other dimensions Principal Components, to see if there is a component that manages to fully resove the three cancer types. PC4 seems to separates better the KICH from KIRP, while PC1 can discriminate between KIRC and KIRP.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: PCA, pairs plots\n\n\n\n\nLet’s check the loadings (i.e.: 24 Principal Components capture more than 80% of the variance in the) for the top 4 Principal Components. These indicate which genes are the more responsible to explain the position of the samples along the components, and the direction of this separation.\nLooking at the top 1% most variable genes (~ 140 genes), the following 5 genes are the top loadings for the first 4 Principal Components:\n\nSPP1\nVIM\nFTL\nRGS5\nLOC96610\n\nLet’s now check the expression of the five top genes identified with the PCA across the cancer types:\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: PCA, loadings\n\n\n\n\nLet’s check the Pearson correlation with other clinical covariates.\nCertain histological and molecular subtyping correlates perfectly with PC4 (which discriminates KICH) immune infiltrating cells also correlates with PC1 and PC2, and may help to further characterize the subtypes and stratify patients\nAs we have learnt before (Section 1.3.7), KIRC patients seems to had a worse outcome than KIRP and to have tumors in more advanced stages. PC1 (computed from transcriptomics data) clearly separates KIRC and KIRP samples, and it correlates with tumor histological grade and stage, as well as clinical outcome. This show that we have good correlation between clinical observations and gene expression in Kidney cancers.\nsadly, no correlation between the top 5 components and the outcome of therapeutic care.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: PCA, correlations between clinical covariates and Principal Components",

    "text": "2.5 WGCNA\nCHECK ALMAOMICS WORK AS WELL\n\n2.5.1 old tutorial\nbacked up from the internet archive. it deserveds a local backup as well\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20230323144343/horvath.genetics.ucla.edu/html/CoexpressionNetwork/Rpackages/WGCNA/\n\n\n2.5.2 additional material\nhttps://bioinformaticsworkbook.org/dataAnalysis/RNA-Seq/RNA-SeqIntro/wgcna.html#gsc.tab=0\nhttps://alexslemonade.github.io/refinebio-examples/04-advanced-topics/network-analysis_rnaseq_01_wgcna.html\n\n2.5.2.1 actually, reconsider the whole strategy altogether\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/bioinformatics/comments/1cr7m9j/what_happened_to_the_wgcna_tutorial/\nWGCNA was an influential concept but the default method is wildly dated and full of fallacies. Even the use of biweight midcorrelation doesn’t address the issues. You simply can’t use correlation on compositional data. Use compositionally valid methods instead like Rho proportionality instead. You can still use the hierarchical clustering but don’t use absolute value or signed transformation. The former makes it difficult to interpret and the latter is even less interpretable. If anything use correlation distance on the proportionality by just doing 1 - rho.\n\nThis describes why you can’t use correlation for compositional data:\n\nhttps://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004075\n\nThis is an adaptation to basically function as a drop in replacement for correlation: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26762323/\n\nThere’s an R package called Propr that implements rho proportionality:\n\nhttps://github.com/tpq/propr\n\nI reimplemented these methods in Python:\n\nhttps://github.com/jolespin/compositional\n\nWhat I recommend, use Rho proportionality then just use the positive associations, then do your clustering with Leiden. If you really want to use hierarchical clustering then do 1 - rho for your distance matrix and use that as input into hclust.\n\nDoesn't normalization account for compositionality of gene count data? Really interested in learning more about this though. Why hasn't this gained more traction? This paper is from 2015, yet I know many research groups applying WGCNA without accounting for proportionality. \n\nIt’s because a lot of researchers don’t want to adapt their methods because what they have “works for them”.\n\nI would read the 2015 proportionality paper. It explains everything much better than I can. I’m not expert in this but I’ve written a review on network analysis. I got my ass handed to me by the reviewers because I was discussing correlation based network analysis. It was one of the toughest review sessions but hands down the most useful learning process for me because I had no idea how bad the issue really was for the field and how many researchers ignore it.\n\nThomas Quinn has some very good reviews too. Between the 2015 paper and the Quinn papers you should be able to get the idea. In a nutshell, compositional data is “parts” data and you don’t have three full abundance therefore ratios between components/genes/otus (whatever feature you have) are what need to be compared between samples. Simple normalization methods don’t address this however there are some transformations that can be helpful but none are a silver bullet as they each have their caveats. Isometric log ratio is probably the most full proof but you end up with d-1 features since you’re looking at ratios between features.\n\n\nTHIS IS A POSSIBILITY FOR CREATINH ANOTHER PACKAGE BY MYSELF AS WELL",

This suggests that some kind of filtering was already applied during the preprocessing steps, together with scaling and normalization of the proteins spectral counts. The absence can therefore as well be ascribed to biological reasons as well, and not only to technical problems with its detection.\nTo preserve this putative biological signal, I replace in each sample the missing values with the minimum spectral count available in that sample.\nLet’s check how the spectral distributions changed.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Proteomics spectral counts after imputation",

The second component PC2, instead, seems to separate KICH and KIRP samples. The separation between KICH and KIRP samples along component PC2 is clearer in the proteomics data than in the transcriptomics data.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: PCA, biplot PC1 x PC2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: PCA, pairs plots\n\n\n\n\nLet’s check the loadings (i.e.: 21 Principal Components capture more than 80% of the variance in the) for the top 4 Principal Components.

PC1 (computed from transcriptomics data) clearly separates KIRC and KIRP samples, and it correlates with tumor histological grade and stage, as well as clinical outcome.

The second component PC2, instead, seems to separate KICH and KIRP samples. The separation between KICH and KIRP samples along component PC2 is clearer in the proteomics data than in the transcriptomics data.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: PCA, biplot PC1 x PC2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: PCA, pairs plots\n\n\n\n\nLet’s check the loadings (i.e.: 21 Principal Components capture more than 80% of the variance in the) for the top 4 Principal Components. These indicate which genes are the more responsible to explain the position of the samples along the components, and the direction of this separation.\n[[[[ADAPT TO PROTEOMICS RESULTS]]]]\nLooking at the top 1% most variable genes (~ 140 genes), the following 5 genes are the top loadings for the first 4 Principal Components:\n\nSPP1\nVIM\nFTL\nRGS5\nLOC96610\n\n[[[[ADAPT TO PROTEOMICS RESULTS]]]]\nLet’s now check the expression of the five top genes identified with the PCA across the cancer types:\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: PCA, loadings\n\n\n\n\nThe miR-200 family as prognostic markers in clear cell renal cell carcinoma\nmir-200c\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31635993/\nLet’s check the Pearson correlation with other clinical covariates.\n[[[[ADAPT TO PROTEOMICS RESULTS]]]]\nCertain histological and molecular subtyping correlates perfectly with PC1 and PC2 (which discriminates KICH) immune infiltrating cells also correlates with PC1 and PC2, and may help to further characterize the subtypes and stratify patients\nAs we have learnt before (Section 1.3.7), KIRC patients seems to had a worse outcome than KIRP and to have tumors in more advanced stages. PC1 (computed from transcriptomics data) clearly separates KIRC and KIRP samples, and it correlates with tumor histological grade and stage, as well as clinical outcome. This show that we have good correlation between clinical observations and gene espression in Kidney cancers.\nsadly, no correlation between the top 5 components and the outcome of therapeutic care.\n[[[[ADAPT TO PROTEOMICS RESULTS]]]]\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: PCA, correlations between clinical covariates and Principal Components",
