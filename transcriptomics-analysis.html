<li>Here we investigate the transcriptomics data across the three Kidney Cancers.</li>
<li>First we filter lowly expressed genes and we do some exploratory analyses on samples, gene expression and clinical covariates.</li>
<li>We then run a formal Differential Gene Expression analysis to identify genes that have different expression levels across the three Kidney cancer types.</li>
<li>We perform Gene Set Enrichment Analyses on the differentially expressed genes to investigate biological and molecular themes that discriminates between the three Kidney cancer types.</li>
<li>Finally, we characterize the tumour micro-environments of the three Kidney cancer types by quantifying the tumour-infiltrating immune cells.</li>

<p>The first step for transcriptomics analysis is to filter genes that are lowly expressed across all samples because they just inflate the data matrix and they do not contribute to the detection of the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.3885">biological signal</a>.</p>
<p>The filtering step results in the removal of 6,472 genes. The graph below reports the density curves of gene expressions (logCPM) before and after filtering of lowly expressed genes. Each line represent a sample. Before filtering, all samples showed a left-hand side shoulder, with a peak below 0 logCPM higher than a second peak centered around 5 logCPM. The peak below 0 logCPM represent all the lowly to non-expressed genes. After filtering, only expressed genes are retained.</p>

<h3 data-number="2.3.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="principal-component-analysis-pca"><span class="header-section-number">2.3.2</span> Principal Component Analysis (PCA)</h3>
<p>The Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is an unsupervised linear dimensionality reduction technique that summarizes large amount of information (as the one in a transcriptomics count table) into a smaller set of summarized variables (Principal Components) that capture the linear relationships between the data. In a transcriptomics dataset, the number of Principal Components equals the number of samples.</p>
<p>The PCA algorithm is run in an iterative manner: the first Principal Component is calculated by finding the line that maximizes the variance between the samples. The second Principal Component is calculated in the same way, with the condition that it is uncorrelated with (i.e., perpendicular to) the first principal component and that it accounts for the next highest variance. The third Principal Component is calculated in the same way, down to the last Principal Component.</p>
<p>To run PCA analyses on transcriptomics data, I recommend the <a href="https://github.com/kevinblighe/PCAtools">PCAtools package</a> by Kevin Blighe and Aaron Lun.</p>

<p>The first 24 Principal Components capture more than 80% of the variance in the Kidney cancers transcriptomics dataset, with the first two components (PC1 and PC2) capturing a bit more than 25% of the variance.</p>
<p>When we project the samples in the PC1 and PC2, we can see that the PC1 separates KIRC from KICH adn KIRP, which instead cluster together. The second component PC2, instead, seems to partially separate KICH and KIRP samples.</p>

<p>We can also investigate other dimensions Principal Components, to see if there is a component that manages to fully resove the three cancer types. PC4 seems to separates better the KICH from KIRP, while PC1 can discriminate between KIRC and KIRP.</p>

<p>Let’s check the loadings (i.e.: 24 Principal Components capture more than 80% of the variance in the) for the top 4 Principal Components. These indicate which genes are the more responsible to explain the position of the samples along the components, and the direction of this separation.</p>
<p>Looking at the top 1% most variable genes (~ 140 genes), the following 5 genes are the top loadings for the first 4 Principal Components:</p>

<li><a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/21645515.2024.2350101">SPP1</a></li>

</div>
<p>Let’s check the Pearson correlation with other clinical covariates.</p>
<p>Certain histological and molecular subtyping correlates perfectly with PC4 (which discriminates KICH) immune infiltrating cells also correlates with PC1 and PC2, and may help to further characterize the subtypes and stratify patients</p>
<p>As we have learnt before (<a href="dataset-exploration.html#sec-dataset-exploration" class="quarto-xref"><span>Section 1.3.7</span></a>), KIRC patients seems to had a worse outcome than KIRP and to have tumors in more advanced stages. PC1 (computed from transcriptomics data) clearly separates KIRC and KIRP samples, and it correlates with tumor histological grade and stage, as well as clinical outcome. This show that we have good correlation between clinical observations and gene expression in Kidney cancers.</p>
<p>Sadly, no correlation between the top 5 components and the outcome of therapeutic care.</p>

<p><a href="https://link.springer.com/protocol/10.1007/978-1-4939-6685-1_19">Differential gene expression</a> (DGE) analysis is used compare gene expression levels between two or more sample groups, in this case, Kidney cancer types. DGE can help in identifying genes involved in a particular biological process, providing information on gene regulation and underlying biological mechanisms. One of the most <a href="https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/gb-2014-15-2-r29">used approaches</a> to identify associations between genes and biological consist in applying generalized linear models, which aims to assign the variation in gene expression to each known variable in the experimental design, such as patient age, ethnicity, cancer type, treatment center taking care of the patients, etc.</p>
<p>In the section above we saw that age, ethnicity (and race) and age had somewhat a correlation with the cancer types. Therefore, we include this covariates in the differential gene expression analysis in order to take their contribution to gene expression variance into account.</p>
<p>Now, we will compare the gene expression across the three different Kidney cancer types, and we will test the following pairwise comparisons for genes that are differentially expressed: KICH vs KIRC, KICH vs KIRP and KIRC vs KIRP.</p>

<p>The first step for transcriptomics ana</p>
<p>For this, I will use <a href="https://github.com/19ADC99/infiltR">infiltR</a>, which runs</p>
<p>It includes three common bulk RNA-seq deconvolution tools for quantification of tumor-infiltrating immune cells: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nmeth.3337">CIBERSORT</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-016-1070-5">MCP-counter</a> and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s13073-019-0638-6">quanTIseq</a>. MCP-counter is used to obtain absolute quantification of infiltrating immune cells, while a more detailed profiling of relative immune cells subtypes is performed with CIBERSORT and quanTIseq.</p>
