From the Xena platform, we can find the data from Pan-Cancer Atlas consortium, which provides textbook high quality datasets that can be explored for target discovery in cancer. TCGA PanCan collects 12,839 samples from 28 organs, 69 primary sites spanning 32 different cancer types. The metadata available for the samples and the subjects include: * biopsys type (metastatic, primary tumor, solid tissue normal) –&gt; data * cancer subtype based on canonical molecular classification (methylation, miRNA, mRNA, proteins, etc.) –&gt; data * cancer subtype based on the immune models –&gt; data * overall survival information –&gt; data For these samples, there are available rich clinical metadata and matched multiomics datasets. We can retrieved the following multiomics readouts: * copy number variants at the gene level –&gt; data * DNA methylation data –&gt; data * gene expression (RNAseq) –&gt; data * micro RNAs (miRNA) –&gt; data * protein expression –&gt; data * somatic mutations –&gt; data All the multiomics readouts are at the gene level, except for the DNA methylation data, that will have to be mapped and normalized at the gene level. Luckily, a mapping file is available as well. Xena provides as well already precomputed enrichments and cell types deconvolutions: * gene programs that are canonical drug targets –&gt; data * homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) –&gt; data * immune signaling –&gt; data * ssGSEA PARADIGM annotations –&gt; data * stemness score based on DNA methylation signals –&gt; data * stemnsess score based on the RNAseq expression of 103 key genes –&gt; data I assure you that integrating all these data will be fun, and it will provide deep insights on each cancer we decided to analyse. cat(&quot;hello!!!\\n&quot;) ## hello!!! multiple transcritpotimcs datsets different cohortsf rom https://xenabrowser.net/datapages/ either horizontal integration or validation set "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
